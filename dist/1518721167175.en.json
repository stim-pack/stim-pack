The festival will put this contemporary attitude under the microscope. Transmediale festival will explore what lies behind the face value of things by means of lectures, debates, panel discussions, film screenings and exhibitions, which address media art in all its different manifestations. As part of the exploration the value of the represented participants&#x2019; work will be scrutinized. The organizers are specifically applying for a grant for the participation in the festival of Dutch and Netherlands-based researchers and (media) artists. These include Nana Adusei-Poku (panel discussion), Florian Cramer (unmoderated dialogue), Femke Herregraven (exhibition and panel discussion), Zachary Formwalt (film screening), Johan van der Keuken (film screening) and Belit Sa&#x11F; (film screening and Q&amp;A).",

The knowledge they have garnered since 2011 will serve as the framework for a new up-to-date research focusing on the challenges and potentials of African cities and communities in and beside water. The researchers maintain that it is in these places that two of the greatest challenges of our time converge: climate change and urbanization. The publication focuses on mapping 7 factors (DESIMER), including demography, economy, socio-political, infrastructure, morphology, environment and resources. Speculative maps are to be generated alongside quantitative data maps. In addition 7 essays will be produced that will throw light on the various factors by, among others, water envoy Henk Ovink,  architect David Adjaye and economist Razia Khan. The photographer Iwan Baan will provide a visual essay for the book. The aim of the publication is to learn from existing strategies and spawn innovative, sustainable urban solutions for climate change in Africa. In addition to research and content-development, the start-up phase includes expanding partnerships, finding a publisher, financial infrastructure and developing a communications strategy.",

By gathering data from official institutions on the one hand and, on the other, harnessing the rural inhabitants&#x2019; local knowledge, NoRA is seeking to make a realistic analysis of the situation. In this respect the factors that lie at the root of the migration stream, such as the limited financial profit from agriculture, play a pivotal role.

The University of the Underground believes that creativity should permeate from the underground and urban spaces right up to the established order.

Sai Honda is seeking to bring out a publication that will collate the stone collection and tell their underlying story. The project is not just about recycling material, but also tells a story about mankind and the current era.  In the same way as diamonds are the result of volcanic processes, these stones are the residue of modern culture. The graphic design is by Akiko Wakabayashi and Lonneke van der Palen is responsible for the photography of the stones.

		"descriptionHtml": "At the invitation of the 11th Sao Paulo Architecture Biennale, OOZE is presenting the results so far of the project &#xC1;gua Carioca. Since 2012 &#xC1;gua Carioca has been researching into the application of decentralized natural water purification by means of endemic plants. In the meantime a working pilot project of the methodology has been realized in Rio. Design&#x2013;based research into local conditions and addressing local top-down and bottom-up networks will form an essential part of the methodology. Alongside the exhibition about &#xC1;gua Carioca, OOZE will also work on the follow-up project &#xC1;gua Paulista during the biennale. This will see the firm applying the knowledge garnered in Rio to the Sao Paulo context. In common with Rio and many other world cities, inadequate waste-water drainage and drinking-water provision also form a threat to public health and the environment in Sao Paulo. In addition OOZE is developing financial management models and a library of endemic plants for the application of the purification installation.\t<div class=\"inline-con\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"inline-con inline-image\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"imco-intext imco noafter nocap\"><div class=\"sizer\" style=\"padding-top:66%;\"></div><div class=\"inr\"><img data-tst=\"66\" src=\"http://content.stimuleringsfonds.nl/files/pro/i_4442/009representatieveafbeeldingweb.jpg\" alt=\"009representatieveafbeeldingweb.jpg\" title=\"&#xC1;gua Paulista\" data-ratio=\"0.66666666666667\" data-owidth=\"603\"></div></div>\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>",

The concept of both the show and the publication has been developed by Hella Jongerius and Louise Schouwenberg, and builds on an on-going theoretical research into the representation of design. Schouwenberg is responsible for the research and publication texts in which she explores the various roles and functions of design in everyday life, and how these can be interpreted in the various contexts in which design is manifest, such as in a museum for example. Using text and image, the book also focuses on objects from the exhibition. Schouwenberg is hoping the book will stimulate research within the design field and contribute to a wide understanding of the necessity and significance of design, particularly in relation to other cultural domains. Irma Boom will design the book and Die Neue Sammlung is responsible for the publication, the launch and distribution, via Verlag der Buchhandlung Walther K&#xF6;nig, among others.",

Reynaert Vosveld is seeking to use this short film to develop and bring together his technical and philosophical ideas. He intends Knuppel to provoke social engagement by articulating his social observations in an expressive animation style. In a 2016 report about the introduction of new truncheons for the Dutch police, Reynaert Vosveld noticed that the emphasis was on the physical impact on the body as a means of underlining authority. Following several incidents in a number of western countries in which the media and the population portrayed the police negatively as a result of their excessive use of violence, Vosveld imagined that the reports did not tally with the image that the police themselves would like to promote. He expected that the police would like to promote themselves as upholders of the law and as civilian protector rather than aggressor. The short film is made as an associative visual research into sentiments, statements and other forms of expressions which, in his opinion, are hugely significant for issues relating to the police and their image.",

The book is probably being published by SubQ and is presented during the Haarlem Stripdagen in 2018. Anne Staal intends to use the start-up grant to focus on style research, set up an online presence, research into moving image and formulate the first thirty pages.",

		"descriptionHtml": "Valery Vallarta Serrano is applying for a grant to prepare a second of edition of the project &#x2018;Walking the Gray Area II: Jewellery as a Social Practice&#x2019;. The project involves an exchange programme that she first launched in 2010 to promote exchange between jewellery designers from Latin America and Europe. This second edition focuses on the subject &#x2018;violence against women&#x2019; and explores the social function of jewellery design as a means of placing the subject on the agenda and instigating discussion. To this end jewellery design will be employed as a reflective resource and coupled to social thinking. Once again, and as part of the project, a travelling exhibition, blog, symposium and a number of workshops are being organized. Valery Vallarta and Antonia Alampi are the curators. A number of jewellery designers are also involved, including Estela Saez Villanova, Andrea Wagner and Claudia Betancour. The start-up grant is to be used to formulate a curatorial statement and to flesh-out the activities. A committee and an advisory council will also be appointed and collaborative partners and sponsors invited to contribute. Valery Vallarta Serrano hopes the project will attract a wide-ranging public in the discussion about jewellery design within the social context of female violence.",

With this book Unger is seeking to both throw light on and emancipate Dutch jewellery. The publication is designed by Irma Boom. All the illustrated jewellery is represented life size.

In order to contribute to knowledge development in this field, the design studio is launching the project &#x2018;Ore Streams&#x2019;, which has been commissioned by the NGV Triennial / the National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne, Australia. Studio Formafantasma is researching material sourcing with a focus on the metal that is used in the design and production of electronic appliances. Applying design thinking and analysis, the studio is working on new design tools and systems for the identification, supply, conversion and reuse of materials. The project tackles three aspects: exhibition objects, video installations and a documentary series. The grant application is for making the documentary series about the recycling sector to point-up the process of recycling metals from electronic products. The documentaries include interviews with recycling firms and NGOs, alongside detailed videos of the separation process and 3D animations of potential future scenarios. In addition collaboration will be sought with experts, formal and informal recycling initiatives, producers and legislative parties. The results will be jointly presented during NGV Triennial from December 2017 to April 2018.",

Some 72 participants will be involved and they will draw on the objects in the repository for inspiration for contemporary designs. Masterclasses organized by MAFB will help guide the participants in how to interpret their craft and their inspiration for a wide public. The masterclass programme will last six months and is headed by internationally working professionals in the field of design, hair styling, make-up, modelling and entrepreneurship. The programme will enable the participants to develop both in terms of content and technique. MAFB&#x2019;s aim is to provide opportunities for a variety of talents and point-up the links between cultural heritage and fashion design to a wide-ranging public.

The research team made up of Personal Architecture, NOHNIK and architectural historian Lara Voerman are commissioned by the Municipality of Weert to tackle this research. The team intends to demonstrate how linking-up innovative future-oriented (climate) interventions with historico-cultural key values can generate extra spatial quality impulses. During the start-up phase the team will organize two round-table talks, involving both the municipality and relevant sounding-board groups, and chart historico-cultural values, climate challenges and related social issues.",

By harnessing design and communication this project should serve to remove obstacles for other local initiatives.

She adopted the Cynic school of philosophy, which in antiquity set itself up as a provocative protest movement against all social conventions. It upheld the doctrine of equality of all people and eschewed material possessions. At that time it was utterly shocking that Hipparchia, as a woman and dressed in rags, promoted Cynic doctrines. The depiction of her life story embraces four levels: that of a love story, a feminist message and an historical account of a philosophical school. The fourth level is an inspiring lesson for contemporary life and addresses the conventions of our current society and the influence these unconsciously exert on us. By using clear black lines Barbara Stok&#x2019;s drawings generally have a graphic character. The story is conveyed by alternating dialogue and illustrations. In places where there is less text she adopts a freer comic-strip form. The rhythm of the illustrations reinforces the fragmented atmosphere: chaotic where anxiety dominates, spacious quietened spreads at moments of reflection. The book runs to 136 pages and is published by Nijgh &amp; Van Ditmar.",

Participants in the project are drawn from a number of disciplines. Four creatives are involved in the design field who have been making new work for Beeldenstorm for some time:  two established creatives Studio Mieke Meijer and Nacho Carbonell; and two emerging creatives: Sigve Knutson and Carlo Lorenzetti. Beeldenstorm anticipates that these designers will generate a thought-provoking synergy and that the potential of the workshop will be optimally used. The designers will be encouraged to branch out and work experimentally.

The project manifests itself by taking a look at contemporary society where different truths exist about topical developments on which everyone has an opinion, or is asked for an opinion.  Wobby.club couples six illustrators and other creatives to six writers to collectively generate a collaborative poster or pamphlet. To this end the organization has engaged Jan Hamstra, Anton Dautzenberg, Stine Jensen, Jip Piet, Joubert Pignon, Maia Matches and Berend Vonk. The pamphlets are presented in Breda&#x2019;s public spaces and the posters put up around the streets. A new edition of the Wobby.club magazine will also come out during the festival, which takes place from 22 September to 22 October 2017.",

For this exhibition Verstand is seeking to further develop his audiovisual installation into an innovative version. He wants specifically to develop the man-machine interaction so as to enable it to be more clearly tangible to the public and its effects explored in greater depth. For ANIMA II Verstand has contacted the company Pufferfish that has undertaken to produce spherical projection hardware for a reduced tariff. In addition Pandelis Diamantides (composer and sound designer) and Dirk Broenink (programmer, artificial intelligence researcher) are collaborating on the project. Roel van Herpt is assisting Verstand in pitching the project to relevant Chinese parties.",

Radenovic is developing a strategy of procedures and interventions on a macro, meso and micro level intended to improve public spaces in general and children&#x2019;s playgrounds in particular. Local authorities such as ICOMOS Bosnia, Studio Zec and LIFT are involved in the project. Dutch partners include the Rotterdam Academy of Architecture, SuperUse and Arjen Oosterman. By means of workshops, Radenovic aims to engender intensive exchange and creation of knowledge between the different parties involved. The project is to result in a publication, a presentation in the Pakhuis de Zwijger, a show in Stroom Den Haag and an interactive website with a webmap. In the long term Radenovic intends to realize the playgrounds.",

The organizers intend this research to push out the boundaries between nutrients, poisons, waste, food and the human and non-human domain.  During the research, human test subjects will be encouraged and enabled, by means of fermentation techniques, to purify their urine into a source of nutrients to grow plants.

As with the previous two editions, the focus will be on finding an alternative structure for the traditional biennial format. Taking the theme &#x2018;Faraway, So Close&#x2019;, 7 duos have been invited to develop 7 interventions for non-urban areas in Slovenia. The duos are made up of an international maker or design firm and a Slovenian professional from outside the design world. Together they will act as the mentors of over 50 participants divided over 7 projects. The teams will be challenged to place local issues in the context of large-scale social issues, such as climate change. In so doing, the curators aim not just to promote a dialogue between different nationalities, but also between disciplines, locations and levels. The organization recognizes the added value of Dutch designers (or designers who have trained in the Netherlands) who with their forward-thinking ideas, openness and innovative vision can be instrumental in generating integral solutions. The 7 selected makers include Formafantasma and Point Supreme, both of which are established in the Netherlands. The organization is working in collaboration with more than 48 makers from 12 European countries, many of whom trained in the Netherlands. In addition to the 7 interventions, there will be more than 50 events and a main exhibition in MAO accompanied by the publication of an exhibition catalogue.",

To achieve this INTI specifically focuses on the qualitative approach to urbanization, for example by looking at how people form a community. INTI&#x2019;s aim is to bring about actual transformation. The programme targets four cities: Alamar (Cuba), Curtiba (Brazil), Nairobi (Kenya) and Shenzhen (China). The central themes are food production, water management and participation. Each city will use research-by-design-workshops to work on a specific theme within the overall coordinating themes. The aim of the workshops is to devise an integral strategic plan that the cities can subsequently put into effect themselves.

SALA wants to involve Dutch knowledge in this urgent brief and, therefore, has launched a collaborative venture with LINT. This research project will see three Dutch design teams take part in an international workshop, after which each team will develop a specific theme or area within the project. In this way the applicant intends to carry out relevant research into new integral forms of dike reinforcement. The central focus is on developing a spatial and interlinking approach where the reinforcement brief for the dikes is combined with other briefs in the field of urbanization, ecology and recreation. With this project, LINT seeks to create a platform for an international exchange of knowledge between Canada and the Netherlands that will provide opportunities for several Dutch designers.",

The start-up grant is to be used for research into how a digital platform and an accompanying dashboard can be adapted to a different local context. Lisbon is to function as case study in this project. The team will work together with a Portuguese expert team on an exploration of the local context, opportunities and challenges, to be realized by means of several round-table talks with local officials, experts and local stakeholders. The start-up grant will result in an online documented process with reports and a series of sketched solutions.",

Therefore WDCD is seeking to build on this with a second edition of the Brazilian event in December 2016 in S&#xE3;o Paulo. The second edition of WDCD will address the themes of communication, urban briefs, cultural awareness, violence against women and refugees. Several international guests will speak during a two-day conference on 13 and 14 December. Dutch designers that the organization hopes to invite include Petra Stienen, Rogier Klomp, DUS architects, Jan Taminiau, Cesare Peeren and MVRDV. In addition one of the finalists of the What Design Can Do Refugee Challenge will give a presentation on the progress of the project. The programme is interspersed with break-out sessions such as workshops, masterclasses and brainstorming sessions, which will be organized in collaboration with the Brazilian partners. As part of the programme WDCD will launch studio sessions with a number of Brazilian design and architecture offices for 10-15 Brazilian and Dutch creatives, providing them with the opportunity to exchange knowledge around the themes of the conference.",

With a background in interior architecture and design education, her practice primarily concentrates on relationships between body and structure and an interest in objects and systems. Her methodology is to create situations where research and design converge in performance. Questioning design practices through queer and feminist frameworks has become a core position and approach. With the grant Maher will broaden her ongoing research to explore ties between digital representations of the body, the development of identity and the production of human subjectivity in greater depth. In this regard she will cooperate with the digital platform <a href=\"http://www.dazeddigital.com,\">dazeddigital.com</a>which will serve as a case study. Together with Jefferson Hack (media theorist), Alice Rawsthorn (design critic) and the Dazed team, Maher has developed digital technology &#x2013; &#x2018;Seductive Criticism&#x2019; &#x2013; with which the body, as represented on digital platforms, can be dissected and analysed. Maher hopes to employ this to devise a new digital method for the interpretation of digital images and the presentation of cultural critique. The research will also yield a live performance that Maher will develop in Stockholm, where Iaspis &#x2013; the Swedish Arts Grants Committee&#x2019;s International Program for practitioners in Visual and Applied Arts, Design and Architecture &#x2013; has invited her for a residency.",

It aims to study the places of the domestic environment, and how these are today shaped by specific objects &#x2013; the bed, the kitchen, the shower.

The result will be a new domestic space shaped by a landscape of furniture, a series of inhabitable sculptures that freeze and crystallize rituals, which will create extraordinary objects for domestic spaces. This tailor-made furniture for the house will transform the private domain into an artificial landscape, a collection of objects in between architecture, architecture modelling and design. <br>Alongside the research, the project will take form in the materialization of the objects, which will be realized with a range of different materials and techniques -wood, metal, glass, concrete and resins. The choice for the materialization of each object will be a transposition of the research, and it will evoke, through textures and materiality, the relation with its origin. <br>During the Jan Van Eyck Academy residency, will be used the expertise of workshops in the different phases of the project: the  Pierre Kemp Lab for developing the research, the Heimo Lab the materialization of the objects, the Charles Nypels Lab for the graphic and publication of the project and the Werner Mantz Lab for a photographic reportage of the objects.<br>During the different phases will be invited a range of different professionals, among architects, designers, writers and artists, photographer to collaborate on specific aspects of the project in interdisciplinary workshops.",

Part of this problem is caused by the use of glass by tourists and the absence of an infrastructure for recycling. At the initiative of the foundation, six Dutch designers designed in 2015 souvenirs from recycled glass to be sold to tourists. This is done in the hotel shops of Our Zanzibar Hotel Group (OZG), a local hotel group with which the foundation cooperates, and at other places. One of the results was the material &#x2018;trending terrazzo&#x2019; in which glass shards are added to the local terrazzo mix. In order to recycle more glass, the foundation is returning to Zanzibar in 2016 with four designers who were also part of the first selection: Pim van Baarsen Oskar Peet and Sophie Mensen (OS&amp;OOS) and Klaas Kuiken. They were asked to design furniture that can be manufactured locally from &#x2018;trending terrazzo&#x2019; material. The designers are starting on this assignment in the Netherlands. The work on the prototypes will be done during one week in Zanzibar with the objective of creating producible products. The target group for the furniture are the hotels on the island that often have to import their furniture. OZG bought the first series of furniture and is responsible for establishing the links with the hotel industry on the island and the local authorities.",

This book recounts and researches the changes in the Chinese society in relation to urban planning and architecture. The applicant states that these changes are threefold. After several decades of growth, the Chinese economy is starting to falter, with the bursting real estate bubble as a symptom. At the same time, urban planners and residents of cities are discovering the &#x2018;soft&#x2019; aspects of urban development. Finally, the Chinese government and the Chinese business community have in many areas increasingly been focused on and active in countries abroad. In the publication, these developments are examined from different perspectives, including the perspective of Dutch architects who are or used to be active in China. The book is composed of a preface, ten essays, two interviews and a photo essay. The essays are written by Zhou Ying (Future Cities Lab), Esther Da Costa Meyer (Princeton University), XML Architecture &amp; Urbanism, and Jeffrey Johnson (Columbia University). After the publication of the book, the initiator organizes a series of three global conversations during which the authors of the essays and the interviewees enter into discussions with a broader audience about the content of the publication. These public events will take place in Amsterdam, New York and Shanghai. To realize this, the applicant cooperates with Pakhuis de Zwijger, Columbia University and the McKinsey Urban China Initiative.",

CORE RELIEF is a seven-day workshop focused on the design and the creation of so-called &#x2018;core relief&#x2019; items. The aim of the workshop is to deploy the creativity of the Dutch design sector in the humanitarian field. In the refugee camps on Lesbos and at other humanitarian missions, the UNHCR distributes standard relief items, called Core Relief Items (CRI). The goal of the workshop is to develop one or more of the following objects: a) CRI with a longer life cycle or with enhanced functionality, b) components for repairing or maintaining CRI, c) items that augment or enhance the functionality of CRI; d) material and medical supplies which support the functioning of the CRI. The products are made by means of an open-source design process and additive manufacturing. It was decided to use open-source design to make sharing and distributing the results with relevant organizations as easy as possible. Given the relatively low cost of 3D printers and the possibility of producing them locally, the choice was made for additive manufacturing. Sixteen Dutch designers participate in the workshop to work under the guidance of four tutors. LATRA has access to a network of twenty-two organizations that can start working with the products directly. The organization also presents the results in the Dutch Embassy in Athens and at one of the partners in Athens, the Greek Free Open Source Software Society.",

The research question is: &#x2018;What design interventions are needed in order to transform the dilapidated public spaces in Sarajevo into playrooms for children again?&#x2019; In this research he makes use of the Dutch expertise in the field of children&#x2019;s playgrounds in the city. The ideas of Aldo van Eyck regarding interspaces in the urban fabric take a central place. With the project he ultimately intends to develop a strategy of procedures and interventions that at an urban level will contribute to the improvement of public areas in general and children&#x2019;s playgrounds in particular. In the initial phase he is looking for, amongst others, partners from the Netherlands and from Bosnia and Herzegovina. He would like to work with local parties, such as ICOMOS Bosnia, Studio Zec and LIFT. With regard to the Dutch partners he intends to work with, amongst others, the Academie van Bouwkunst (Academy of Architecture), Yttje Feddes and Arjen Oosterman.",

His design practice is characterised by a multidisciplinary approach which pays special attention to the interaction between graphic and typeface design. Benjamin Sporken believes that typography forms the communicative foundation for virtually all media, both in digital and print forms. He has notes that the development of type design appears to be stagnating, especially because there seems to be a preference for the overall legibility of letters. To contribute to the positioning and development of type design, Benjamin Sporken wants to set up his own platform, entitled ONMIN (&#x2018;discord&#x2019;). To put type design in a historical context, Benjamin Sporken will participate in the Expert Class Type Design masterclass. In addition, he&#x2019;ll seek out advice from British design agency FIELD and several forward-thinking type designers and so-called &#x2018;type foundries&#x2019;. Step by step, he&#x2019;ll work on creating new characters, innovative production methods, applications and exhibition formats for typeface design. By starting his own type foundry, Sporken intends to challenge conventions and differentiate himself within the design field. In addition, the concept of ONMIN will give him the opportunity to create a business model that contributes to the development of his professional practice.",

For example, for her &#x2018;Blue Hour&#x2019; graduation project she developed a collection of light objects that are programmed to perform a specific choreography. Over the coming year she wants to follow this up with the &#x2018;Performa&#x2019; project, which zooms in on the discrepancy between entertainment in the public space and the static domestic environment, in which lighting and movement once again play an important role. Paula Arntzen collaborates with various professionals to realize her objects and is studying programs such as Sketchup and Solidworks.

He believes that this touches upon the origins of jewellery, given that since time immemorial it was developed by primitive people in the guise of bestial and natural materials in order to assume their (mythical) powers. Nowadays, the designer asserts, the developments within bio-design are leading to increasingly blurred boundaries between humankind and technology. The makeability of the human body is thus a point of departure for his ongoing design-driven research project &#x2018;Paradise&#x2019;, which over the coming year he wants to expand into a multidisciplinary project in which jewellery, dance, video and photography converge. The goal that Frank Verkade has set himself for the coming year is to develop himself into a multidisciplinary designer. He will be expanding his expertise and skills by taking courses for the computer programs Rhino and CAD, film editing and working in precious metals. In addition, he will be seeking intrinsic enrichment under the supervision of the American film director Andrew Thomas Huang and designers Ted Noten and Bart Hess.

He thereby expects to move closer to the applicability of models in the design process. Bakker prefers to conduct research in a spatial and experimental way that proceeds from a theoretical framework. The research consists of three phases. In phase one Bakker is analysing the different aspects of the model, including function, formal idiom, proportionality and use of materials. He will then conduct a series of spatial experiments. Lastly, the insights gained will be applied in designing with models. He is deliberately leaving open the form in which the results of the research will be made manifest. During the research Bakker will be consulting with several experts from other disciplines, including a scenographer, a filmmaker, artists and graphic designers. in order to develop his technical skills in the fields of rendering and augmented reality, The designer is undertaking work placements with a photographer and an AR specialist.

		"descriptionHtml": "Mariska de Groot gained her MA from the ArtScience Interfaculty of the Royal Academy of Art (KABK) in The Hague in 2012. In her work De Groot focuses on the realm of optical sound, which involves light being directly transformed into sound and vice versa. She often bases this on old and forgotten media, such as the humming-top and harmonograph. De Groot reveals the technology behind these historical machines by enlarging the components and dismantling them. This leads to kinetic light and sound installations in which she translates the rational into a sensitive and immersive experience. In her development plan, De Groot explains that she needs a period of research and reflection as a counterpoint to her practice. The first of the two lines of research concern the phenomenological behaviour of plasma lamps in the transformation of light into sound. The second research project stems from a personal fascination with round geometric patterns. Within this process De Groot will be investigating round patterns from all kinds of angles: anatomic, mystical, cultural. Alongside the research, she will be participating in a number of residencies, including one at STEIM that focuses on the work LFS1. In the realm of professionalization, De Groot wants to deploy a mentor to help her learn to make decisions more quickly. Furthermore, she is planning to follow a number of training courses in the field of media presentation.\t<div class=\"inline-con\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"inline-con inline-image\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"imco-intext imco noafter nocap\"><div class=\"sizer\" style=\"padding-top:56%;\"></div><div class=\"inr\"><img data-tst=\"56\" src=\"http://content.stimuleringsfonds.nl/files/pro/i_3895/005representatieveafbeelding.jpg\" alt=\"005representatieveafbeelding.jpg\" title=\"Mariska de Groot\" data-ratio=\"0.56731583403895\" data-owidth=\"3543\"></div></div>\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>",

Dovey uses performances and installations to pose critical questions about the promises and dangers of big data, artificial intelligence and the use of computers. Over the coming year Dovey will be developing a scenario-driven live action game about blockchain technology. A blockchain is a distributed database that tracks a constantly growing list of data items that are protected from manipulation and falsification. A blockchain means it is unnecessary for a third party to safeguard the trustworthiness of a transaction. The game brings players in contact with the potential significance of blockchain technology for alternative forms of economic organization and new forms of social governance. The designer is working with Professor Chris Speed (Design Informatics, University of Edinburgh). In order to develop his qualities in the field of performance, Dovey is pursuing a residency with Blast Theory, an English theatre company. He is also cooperating with the Design my Privacy initiative as he works on several publications and events about the subject of digital privacy.",

She therefore wants to develop two collections and scrutinize her positioning abroad. During exploratory trips to London and Japan she wants to enter into discussion with various parties and reflect on her design practice. The research into new as well as traditional techniques, materials and production methods is pivotal within the collections. She will be designing a new accessories collection &#x2013; &#x2018;Modern Heritage 2.0&#x2019; &#x2013; that should lead to a modern interpretation of traditions.

Ruiter Jansen wants to work on two projects over the coming year: Apartheid Revisited and Two Sides of New Amsterdam. Jansen wants to depict the history of apartheid in an interactive data landscape and thus increase knowledge and awareness of it among today&#x2019;s generation. For this project he is already working with a former South Africa correspondent and expert on apartheid, Bart Luirink. He also intends to establish a collaboration with the Rotterdam-based Bureau Buitengewone Zaken design agency. In the &#x2018;Two Sides of New Amsterdam&#x2019; project the designer is investigating the process of appropriating the historical past. He argues that phrases such as &#x2018;our past&#x2019; and &#x2018;in the olden days we used to...&#x2019; lay a claim to history. He will use New York (formerly New Amsterdam) as an example. For this latter project the designer wants to join forces with historian Jaap Jacobs, an expert on Dutch immigrants in the USA, and others.\t<div class=\"inline-con\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"inline-con inline-image\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"imco-intext imco noafter nocap\"><div class=\"sizer\" style=\"padding-top:66%;\"></div><div class=\"inr\"><img data-tst=\"66\" src=\"http://content.stimuleringsfonds.nl/files/pro/i_3901/005representatieveafbeelding.jpg\" alt=\"005representatieveafbeelding.jpg\" title=\"Ruiter Jansen\" data-ratio=\"0.668\" data-owidth=\"1000\"></div></div>\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"inline-con inline-image\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"imco-intext imco noafter nocap\"><div class=\"sizer\" style=\"padding-top:66%;\"></div><div class=\"inr\"><img data-tst=\"66\" src=\"http://content.stimuleringsfonds.nl/files/pro/i_3901/005representatieveafbeelding.jpg\" alt=\"005representatieveafbeelding.jpg\" title=\"Ruiter Jansen\" data-ratio=\"0.668\" data-owidth=\"1000\"></div></div>\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>",

In this collection she will be printing garments onto other garments, so that individual features and mutual differences become evident. In addition, she will be immersing herself in alternative economic models and exploring responsible means of production, distribution and marketing. At the same time she is determined to increase the online visibility of her work, organize collection presentations at various venues, and produce a publication. Her intrinsic development will involve studying the relevant literature and establishing a dialogue with other designers, artists and curators.

		"descriptionHtml": "Hannah Schubert graduated as a landscape architect from the Amsterdam Academy of Architecture in 2015. Schubert&#x2019;s projects are situated at the interface of architecture and landscape. In her graduation project Schubert investigated how the power of nature can be deployed in order to gradually transform a vacant or &#x2018;failed&#x2019; building into a landscape. The landscape architect wants to approach the archetype of the ruin in a non-nostalgic manner and thus generate valuable places, where nature rules and people can come and visit if so desired. For her development pathway Schubert describes three components: the acquisition of greater ecological expertise, knowledge of various representation techniques, and the dissemination of her own distinctive position within (landscape) architecture. Within these components she will call on mentors, undertake excursions, conduct design-driven research and produce presentations. Schubert wants to record her personal development in an online journal. Furthermore, the landscape architect is working on a presentation at Castle Groeneveld, where the enrichment of the design-driven research as well as the development in representation techniques can be made manifest.",

The cooperation is structured as a design and production studio with a focus on digital design techniques and innovative means of production. RAP describes the amalgamated role of architect and producer as the &#x2018;digital master-builder&#x2019;. In its development plan Studio RAP describes how it wants to evolve and establish a profile in this role over the coming year. The studio is therefore working on a hybrid manifesto that consists of design-driven research and a survey of the literature. RAP is thus endeavouring to set the practice of digital architecture in an historical context by demonstrating that new production and design techniques always lead to new architecture. In the design-driven research these creatives combine a parametric design process with digital production in order to arrive at a full-scale prototype which embodies the vision for digital architecture. Besides perfecting the parametric design process and the digital manufacture of elements, much of the research is focused on assembling these elements with the aid of robot arms. RAP expects that the step in the digitalization and automation of production will lead to more expressive forms. The studio wants to present the results of the design-driven research at venues such as architecture centres, but also in public spaces like Rotterdam&#x2019;s main railway station. In the sphere of professionalizing its practice, the studio is primarily focusing on the improvement of its communications.\t<div class=\"inline-con\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"inline-con inline-image\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"imco-intext imco noafter nocap\"><div class=\"sizer\" style=\"padding-top:66%;\"></div><div class=\"inr\"><img data-tst=\"66\" src=\"http://content.stimuleringsfonds.nl/files/pro/i_3912/005representatieveafbeelding.jpg\" alt=\"005representatieveafbeelding.jpg\" title=\"Studio RAP\" data-ratio=\"0.66666666666667\" data-owidth=\"5616\"></div></div>\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>",

Graphic designer Joel Booy graduated from Design Academy Eindhoven in 2014, in order to reorient himself towards product design. In Truly Truly&#x2019;s practice the fascination with the relationship between the natural and the unnatural is key. This is made manifest in objects in which the industrial production process is combined with abstract organic details. The work has a sculptural or poetic character, which involves Truly Truly operating at the intersection of industry and autonomous art. At the invitation of the TextielMuseum in Tilburg, the studio developed novel and innovative methods that transpose handicraft techniques into machine-knitting techniques. This has resulted in a diversity of successful projects, such as &#x2018;Soundskins&#x2019; for LEFF Amsterdam and a textile collection for Fest Amsterdam.\t<div class=\"inline-con\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"inline-con inline-image\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"imco-intext imco noafter nocap\"><div class=\"sizer\" style=\"padding-top:66%;\"></div><div class=\"inr\"><img data-tst=\"66\" src=\"http://content.stimuleringsfonds.nl/files/pro/i_3913/005representatieveafbeelding.jpg\" alt=\"005representatieveafbeelding.jpg\" title=\"Studio Truly Truly\" data-ratio=\"0.66666666666667\" data-owidth=\"2400\"></div></div>\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"inline-con inline-image\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"imco-intext imco noafter nocap\"><div class=\"sizer\" style=\"padding-top:66%;\"></div><div class=\"inr\"><img data-tst=\"66\" src=\"http://content.stimuleringsfonds.nl/files/pro/i_3913/studiotrulytruly.jpg\" alt=\"studiotrulytruly.jpg\" title=\"Studio Truly Truly\" data-ratio=\"0.66666666666667\" data-owidth=\"720\"></div></div>\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>",

She makes this evident in her work in a playful way, by sketching dystopian and utopian scenarios that the public can fathom out by means of a game.

The game is based on the fictitious hyper-surveillance of current asylum policy and Europe&#x2019;s asylum industry. Janna Ullrich wants to use the coming period to develop the game further and professionalize her own design practice. She is therefore organizing playing sessions for experts in the realms citizenship, refugee policy and the security industry, with whom she will reflect on the content-related and conceptual elaboration of the game, calling into question the designer&#x2019;s own design and research method. In addition, she is taking a course in technical skills for After Effects, Cinema 4D and 3D software. She is also working with professional game developers, including Erno Eekelhout and Filip Milunski, on the game&#x2019;s technical improvement. Furthermore, Ullrich is working together with documentary-maker Paramita Nath and producer Karen Ella Harnisch on a gaming documentary. The game will be presented at universities, theatres, schools, companies and community centres.

Ursae Minoris sprang from an interdisciplinary collaboration between visual art, music and science. The piece is based on celestial charts and is shown to best advantage in dome-shaped theatres of planetariums and observatories. With the performance Stichting Solaris wants to interest new audiences in the combination of performance and media art by organizing performances in astronomical and academic institutions.

The Tactical Media movement can be seen as a cultural and political trend that emerged with the rise of new media in the early 1990s. Characteristic of the movement is its specific approach to media productions and the role for non-traditional media makers, including artists, activists, media pirates and dissidents. The trickster is an archetypal character who slickly manages to escape the dominant holders of power and is thus an exemplary figure for the power-less. The exhibition&#x2019;s starting point is the influence, not be underestimated, of the rise and development of new media on our world and the role of the trickster in this regard. Three works are being commissioned from Ruben Pater (NL), Ian Alan Paul (US) and Morehshin Allahyari (Iran). Besides Amsterdam, iterations of the exhibition will be presented at FACT in Liverpool and HEK in Basel. A contiguous publication will be released by the MIT Press in 2017.",

Over time, their focus has shifted from electronic media and technology to cultivation media and developments in food and biotechnology. The foundation serves as a cultural incubator and focuses on research, development and presenting new work. Their programme grew out of an interest in the tension between culture and nature, and featured topics include biomaterials, eating and drinking, scents, environment, DIY and tools. These topics are presented in a variety of ways. In addition to traditional formats like presentations, exhibitions, publications and workshops, there&#x2019;s also room for experimental formats such as the Bio Clean Lab, a pilot project with primary schools, and the Bio Art Supplies shop. To create this programme, Mediamatic works with a wide range of partners including Waag Society, STEIM, Hamburger Bahnhof Berlin, VU, UU department of mycology, Oedipus Brewing and Food Logica. Since 2015, Mediamatic has been headquartered in Dijkspark, a new location near Amsterdam&#x2019;s Central Station. The convenient location offers an opportunity to run a profitable side business. The concept is a restaurant that transcends a simple place to eat. It also unfolds into a stage for the Mediamatic programme which revolves around experimentation and innovation.",

The related artistic principles include: Relational Aesthetics, Open &amp; Critical Making, Users as Designers and Learning by Making.<br>The Waag&#x2019;s programme is divided into six thematic labs. Each lab has an appointed head researcher who puts together an agenda and specific research queries with the rest of the team. For example, the Future Internet Lab focuses on the morality of technology. Open Wetlab and Open Design Lab are taking a critical approach to the creative culture within biotechnology and the manufacturing, respectively. The Creative Learning Lab, Creative Care Lab and Future Heritage Lab are examining crossovers between e-culture, education, healthcare and heritage. The organisation is also looking into the potential of new labs related to nanotechnology, quantum technology and aerospace. Artistic research and experimentation are at the centre of the labs&#x2019; methodology. The results of this type of research might lead to concrete applications, but it&#x2019;s more important that the experiments themselves are visible in society. Waag Society therefore organises exhibitions and attempts to build and maintain communities and platforms around their labs. Waag Society positions itself as a networking organisation: they assemble a consortium of Dutch and international partners around each lab. In addition, they have an extensive Academy programme. Academy participants include schools, teachers, makers, civil servants, curators and healthcare professionals.",

Their programming is divided into three main themes: intimate technology, next natural habitat and people of tomorrow.  Some of the planned activities within these themes include: &#x2018;Forward to Nature&#x2019;, a publication which explains the concept of getting closer to nature; Next Senses, a research programme where young makers speculate about new sense and sensory applications; Meat the Future Expo, a physical exhibition about a fictional restaurant that &#x2018;cultivates&#x2019; meat; ECOcoin.com, a platform for an alternative currency that represents ecological value; Letter to Humanity, a letter by founder Koert van Mensvoort and  &#x2018;Artficial Womb&#x2019; a debate-provoking piece about human reproduction, emancipation and family structures. In addition to these activities, Next Nature Network will be investing in editorial support for nextnature.net.

As a presentation and networking organisation, the institution offers exhibitions, lectures, debates and other activities related to architecture and design from a social perspective. It focuses primarily on Europe and the Euroregion and the associated social agendas. Bureau Europe doesn&#x2019;t only want present itself as reflective and representative, it also wants to act as an intermediary between the economic, social and cultural realities. For the 2017-2020 period, the organisation will focus on the themes healthcare and illness, social inclusivity, energy transition, (digital) transparency and control, and financial and demographic decline. Bureau Europe believes that the design disciplines can play a role in these social challenges by creating alternative perspectives. These themes will be reflected in exhibitions, workshops, lectures and debates.",

For this the designer is collaborating with a group of dancers who react directly to the software so that the digital output is visible in their costumes, which in turn demands a further response. This creates an immediate and interactive influence between clothing and choreography, whereby performance is approached as a design tool. With this project Jessica Smarsch aims to visually reveal the interrelationship between the human body, soul and design, while at the same time underlining the personal and cultural value of the design.",

		"descriptionHtml": "<strong>Ningo Prampram - Planned City Extension in the Greater Accra Region</strong><br><br>The growth of Accra is a matter of concern: within 30 years, Accra grew from a city with a radius of 10 km into a continuous, urban agglomeration that stretches over 60 km along the coastline. With a staggering growth rate of 4.6 per cent, the population is expected to grow from 2.5 million in 2011 to 4.2 million in 2020. In Accra, the speed of speculation has consistently outpaced the speed of planning, resulting in regular severe flooding, daily traffic collapse and the absence of basic utilities and basic services in many parts of the agglomeration.<br><br>Good spatial planning and design assistance directly affect the municipalities&#x2019; capacity to meet these challenges and deliver a more liveable and resilient piece of city.<br><br>On UN-Habitat&#x2019;s initiative, a National Priority Project has been established that will entail a planned extension of Accra into the adjacent Ningo-Prampram district. Both local and national government &#x2013; and the private sector &#x2013; have shown considerable interest in the plan, and support its moving forward towards implementation with a steering committee that has the mandate to approve and a development body tasked with implementing the plan. The Ghanaian-Dutch team of planners, consisting of urban and landscape designers and water and infrastructure experts, is helping to further build this momentum and to design the city extension of Ningo Prampram, which encompasses a total land area of about 100 km. In the future it will be able to accommodate a significant amount of the growth predicted in the Greater Accra Agglomeration.<br><br>Planning a city extension for an assumed 1 to 1.5 million people is beyond what typically can be grasped by the experience of humans. One cannot design a city of that size. But one can put basic systems into place that allow a city to grow over time. The approach to the planned city extension in Ningo Prampram therefore consisted of three key aspects: How can a system be established that mitigates the biggest risk &#x2013; regular flooding? How can a system be crafted that provides basic services, that can mature over time and that is relatively easy to understand and manage? How can the often finite ideas of &#x2018;Newtownism&#x2019; be avoided, and instead room be made for growth and gradual maturing as an integral part of urban development?<br><br>Making a big plan never works without local rooting. In dialogue with local planners, representatives and through site visits, the design team defined the plan&#x2019;s key objectives. In these conversations it became obvious that creating broad support is essential to making the plan happen on the ground. Consequently, recent focus &#x2013; besides on refining the plan &#x2013; has been on activating all key players in the process, from the local stakeholders to the President of Ghana. So far this has been successful on all political levels. In a next step the plan has to find the acceptance of the local population and start attracting investment from both the private sector and global institutions. A much greater challenge, but one that is essential to inclusive planning.<br><br><strong>Team:</strong><br>Markus Appenzeller &#x2013; MLA+, mlaplus.com<br>Eric Frijters &#x2013; Fabric, fabrications.nl<br>Martin Knuijt &#x2013; OKRA, okra.nl<br>Daan Roggeveen &#x2013; MORE ARCHITECTURE, more-architecture.com<br>Ingeborg Thoral &#x2013; MIXST URBANISME, mixst.nl",

		"descriptionHtml": "<strong>Urban Renewal Strategy in Doctores, Mexico City</strong><br><br>In Mexico, urban renewal has become a major development strategy. In the case of about 7 million houses built in remote areas, increasing commuting costs have forced many residents to move, abandoning their homes. An adequate framework for urban renewal could tackle sprawl, reduce congestion and bring residents closer to their work. In this context, the national housing programme Sustainable Urban Development (DUIS), introduced in the late 2000s, could become a powerful tool for sustainable housing. Combined with urban renewal strategies, DUIS can contribute to the supply of low-income housing in a way that is less environmentally damaging and more socially inclusive. UN-Habitat is organising an Expert Group Meeting (EGM) to discuss the urban renewal of seven project areas in Mexico Federal District.<br><br>The establishment of a planning lab will enable Dutch planners to engage in one of the salient urban challenges in Mexico. The planners can tap into international expertise by using the recommendations and instruments suggested by the EGM and applying them to an in-depth strategy for one of the seven project areas. For local counterparts, this is an opportunity to tackle the complex legal and financial context behind urban renewal with a project approach.<br><br>The UN Mexico team is working on Doctores, a central neighbourhood in Mexico City. Doctores has a rather low density &#x2013; like most of central Mexico City &#x2013; and is slightly run-down. SEDUVI (Secretar&#xED;a de Desarrollo Urbano y Vivienda ) sees chances to densify and improve Doctores so more people can profit from its proximity to jobs and infrastructure. The creation of an SAC (Sistema de Actuaci&#xF3;n por Cooperaci&#xF3;n) should open up development. But this is a new and mostly economic-juridical instrument. The key challenge is to show how the application of the SAC can be used to direct urban quality and give opportunities to different social groups in the area. The UN team defined the following ambitions:<br><br><blockquote>Densify:<br></blockquote>Intensify the area with a mixed programme to reach a more compact city, respecting existing qualities and scales, and intensify green space within organic and flexible growth.<br><blockquote>Social Mix:<br></blockquote>Mix existing and new inhabitants, to avoid gentrification. Build new housing for social groups, including a mix of functions and urban economies for different groups.<br><blockquote>Co-create:<br></blockquote>Develop with smart governance, publicprivate collaborations and strategies, smart rules and financial mechanisms and interweave participation in the process.<br><blockquote>Sustain:<br></blockquote>Doctores is the pilot project for sustainable urban renewal.<br><br>At the moment, the UN Mexico team is developing different densification scenarios using the SAC rules. Densification is connected to improved, sustainable public space structures. By taking the mechanism of building, land, rent and sales prices into consideration, we are trying to discover what housing types are feasible (or can be made feasible). Finally, we are focusing on new ways of trading potential air rights, to connect supply and demand at fair and transparent prices. The challenge remains how to develop a clear strategy that aligns with existing regulations, clearly shows the value for all stakeholders and can be incorporated into the urban renewal process in the next decade.<br><br><strong>Team:</strong><br>Jaap Klaarenbeek &#x2013; Klaarenbeek Stedenbouw Architectuur &amp; Strategie<br>Marco Broekman &#x2013; marco.broekman urbanism research architecture, marcobroekman.com<br>Kristin Jensen &#x2013; Morgenstad, morgenstad.nl<br>Gerwin de Vries &#x2013; LINT landscape architecture, landscapeinterventions.nl<br><br><strong>With:</strong><br>UN Habitat Urban Lab (Nairobi), UN Habitat (Mexico City) and SEDUVI (Mexico City), Urban Lab Doctores, Mexico City",

		"descriptionHtml": "New Economy and New Paradigm, Yangon Myanmar stands at a defining point in its recent history. Since 2011, the country has seen a general trend towards social and economic liberalization and a more marketoriented economy, which will inevitably lead to increasing urbanization. Ambitiously, the country is anticipating this growth by preparing plans for over 200 cities. The new planning law, which is expected to come into effect at any moment, encourages cities to make plans and offers a unique opportunity to define the future of many of Myanmar&#x2019;s cities.<br><br>The current urban development practice, however, has to deal with the multifaceted pressures of rapid urbanization and can best be described as lagging-behind or reactive planning: the governmental bodies have limited capacity, limited resources of valuable data and are operating in a period of governmental restructuring, while awaiting the new planning law. There is a great demand for a new comprehensive planning vision. Establishing a lab of Dutch planners collaborating with local planners enables them both to significantly contribute to a better urban future for Myanmar.<br><br>The assignment is to create a comprehensive master plan for an exemplary city extension for the township of Htantabin, located in the western part of the Capital of Yangon, which is planning six new expansion areas to accommodate its rapid growth. The Htantabin city extension site is currently mainly agricultural land with a few villages and limited infrastructure. The projected population for the Htantabin city extension in 2040 ranges from 2.4 to 2.7 million people. The aim is to develop a master plan and implementation strategy together with local planners, using the recently formulated Guidelines for Urban Planning by UN-Habitat as a starting point. Now that Myanmar is decentralizing its planning expertise, the process includes a strong &#x2018;learning by doing&#x2019; component for the local counterpart.<br><br>Htantabin is located along the main roads to the west coast and to the agricultural lands in the north known as the &#x2018;ricebowl of Yangon&#x2019;. Because of this and its proximity to central Yangon, the Htantabin area is under great pressure from growing industrial sites, (private) residential developments and the sprawl of the informal settlements of rural-to-urban migrants. At the same time it faces a multitude of issues: both flooding and insufficient water provision, polluting solid waste management, traffic congestion, (illegal) land speculation and all challenges related to the typical &#x2018;Arrival City&#x2019;. The aim is to tackle these issues not with singular solutions, but through an integral master plan that functions as a strategic framework rather than a blueprint design, thereby setting ambitious goals for future urban plans.<br>During a first mission in February, the team took a group of local planners from the Ministry of Construction (MOC) and the Yangon City Development Committee (YCDC) through the design process of analysis and assessments towards synthesis and concept development.<br><br>The current concept master plan is based on a series of principles, an elaboration of the five principles of UN-Habitat. The next step will be to elaborate the plan in conjunction with the governmental bodies within the urban development framework for Yangon City, as part of the 100 days programme of the new government, as well as the formulation of an Implementation strategy, based on legal and economic foundations. Moving forward to a new planning paradigm, the main challenges in this process will be the following:<br><blockquote>Making the switch from a lagging-behind, reactive planning practice to a more proactive one with the current limited capacity and available resources.<br></blockquote><blockquote>Dealing with the international &#x2018;help overdose&#x2019;. There is an influx of international consultancies and NGOs to assist these governmental bodies in capacity building to an extent that their limited manpower is being challenged.<br></blockquote><blockquote>Dealing with the aspect of identity: Is the identity of a place a result of cumulated developments or a prescripted one based on a vision? And how does one maintain one&#x2019;s genius loci with the abovementioned foreign influx?<br></blockquote><br><strong>Team:</strong><br>Jean-Paul Hitipeuw &#x2013; Urban Codes, urbancodes.nl<br>Han Dijk &#x2013; Posad, posad.nl<br>Michiel van Driessche &#x2013; Felixx Landscape Architects &amp; Planners, felixx.nl<br>Darrel Ronald &#x2013; Maketank, maketank.org<br><br><strong>With:</strong><br>UN Habitat Myanmar, Ministry of Construction (MOC) and Yangon City Development Committee (YCDC)",

The massive scale of physical damage suffered after the 2014 conflict in Gaza has displaced over 500.000 people. Many are housed in refugee conflict camps or temporary shelters, while others live in the ruins of their cities and villages. At the same time, settlements have seen an influx of displaced people, leading to uncontrolled development and expansion in the cities and around the fringes of towns, encroaching on agricultural land. Beyond damaging the housing stock, the crisis has left Gaza with significant damage in road infrastructure, water, electricity and waste.<br><br>The damage has been devastating for the livelihood of Palestinians, as the already fragile economy dependent on Israeli policies and restrictions has been further impaired by the physical destruction of many economic centres and a great deal of agricultural land. In the Palestinian town of Khuza&#x2019;a the post-conflict situation of 2014 is persisting to this date, as the international community has been hesitant to step in and rebuild the town under the Hamas-led de facto government of the Gaza Strip.<br><br>Recently, UN-Habitat has taken the initiative to show that a participatory design approach can work in post-conflict situations and has assembled a local team of planners (NTSC) to support the Khuza&#x2019;a municipality in drafting a master plan, under the motto &#x2018;Build Back Better&#x2019;.

		"descriptionHtml": "<strong>Resilience to climate change, Tacloban City</strong><br><br>Tacloban was one of the cities severely hit in 2013 by typhoon Yolanda. This typhoon was one the strongest tropical typhoons ever recorded and killed at least 6.300 people in the Philippines alone. The local government of Tacloban has, with support from UN-Habitat and the United Nations Development Programme, organized several planning charrettes to brainstorm and discuss strategies for the spatial development of Tacloban, addressing emergency, recovery and long-term rehabilitation needs. The city is visited by on average of 20 typhoons a year, and 42 of the city&#x2019;s 138 villages are classified as danger zones. Besides reconstruction issues, however, rapid urbanization also poses a great challenge to the country&#x2019;s ability to achieve sustainable urban development. Urbanization in the Philippines is expected to increase from 50 per cent currently to 84 per cent by 2050. This growth is expected to happen not only in the capital city Manila, but mainly in small and intermediate cities such as Tacloban. The only way to obviate this growth by urban planning is to take the postdisaster and flooding context into account very carefully. <br><br>When the team arrived in Tacloban, it soon became clear that it was dealing with a post-relief-planning situation instead of post-disaster-planning: typhoon Yolanda and its aftermath had started a dynamic and elaborate rehabilitation planning process with many relief organizations providing financial and expert support, volunteers organising mapping marathons, and local government being invited to many planning workshops. The team immediately reformulated its original assignment: instead of designing rehabilitation and resettlement plans, it focused on giving advice on the comprehensive land-use planning process<br>and integrating the numerous constructed settlement sites and infrastructural works into an integrated and clear structural urban plan. The availability of extensive site data made it possible to make detailed specialist studies such as geo-hazard maps, land value analyses and space-syntax maps. The organic state of the planning process as well as the challenging economic and infrastructural situation on the ground required the team to work with adaptive and flexible planning procedures and principles that will allow Tacloban to continue the most positive development in the future. While writing this text the team is in Tacloban working on the final formation of the comprehensive land-use plan in collaboration with UN-Habitat and the City of Tacloban.

The symposium comprises presentations, workshops and debates.

In association with a team of Dutch architects and urban planners, Gert Jan Scholte intends to initiate a spatial study into the integral design of city and river in India. The pilot is focusing on the relationship of the &#x2018;Smart Cities&#x2019; of Saharanpur and Ghaziabad with the Hindon river, concentrating on how to restore the quality of the river and the surrounding urban space, thus ensuring its place in the rapidly expanding city. The start-up subsidy will be employed to bring together and extend the involvement of various parties in the Netherlands and India, as well as to demarcate the project area.",

The applicant refers, among other things, to the way the New Dutch Waterline was approached. The aim of this research is to write a vision for the conservation of the Austro-Hungarian defence network that addresses the realms of culture, ecology and the economy. In addition, the applicant envisages producing an &#x2018;Export manual for the Dutch expertise on heritage &amp; space&#x2019;.

This open call is aimed at the deepening of artistic and professional development of designers and practitioners who belong among the international top in the creative industries (e-culture, design, architecture). Textile designer Claudy Jongstra was among last year&#x2019;s recipients of this grant for artistic and professional development. A precondition for receiving support is entering into a collaboration with an international institution, organization or business with an excellent reputation. Jongstra works with the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA) to design a &apos;mural&apos; for the museum.</strong><br><br>SFMOMA is the first public institution at the westcoast of the USA to give such a prominent place to a large, autonomous textile work by Jongstra, who created the wall installation specifically for this space. She undertook a comprehensive investigation prior to beginning the production process, which is typical of her manner of working. &apos;&quot;Taking care of&quot; and &quot;doing justice to&quot; are concepts that are pivotal in my life and work,&apos; Jongstra explains. &apos;Likewise in this project. By using raw materials, colours extracted from plants and the ingenuity of what human hands can create using traditional techniques such as spinning, weaving and embroidery, I transform a work of art into a contemporary composition. With the concept of &quot;taking care&quot; I&#x2019;m placing a big question mark against the way people treat their living environment and nature. So for the SFMOMA mural, <em>Erdgold XL</em>, I&#x2019;ve been carrying out research into the possibilities of extracting natural colours from minerals: the gold of the earth that the prospectors who came to San Francisco were searching for so assiduously.&apos;<br><br><strong>Autonomous production of raw materials</strong><br>Jongstra has developed a self-supporting production chain and farms her own raw materials. She keeps her own herd of the rare Drenthe heathland sheep and she operates a dye works that uses plants which she cultivates herself. &apos;The Fund&#x2019;s contribution gave me the opportunity to conduct research for longer during the developmental phase that is so essential. This exhaustive research process adds depth to my artistic development and ultimately you&#x2019;ll notice that in this mural,&apos; says Jongstra.<br><br>You can read about the other selected projects from last year&#x2019;s Open Call Talent Development in an International Context <a href=\"http://stimuleringsfonds.nl/en/latest/news/selection_open_call_for_international_talent_development/\">here</a>.

Thanks to the Creative Industries Fund NL in collaboration with the Dutch Games Association and Dutch Game Garden, 10 Dutch game developers were selected to travel to Cologne to showcase their games at the Holland Pavilion.</strong><br><br>In order to be fully prepared for the Gamescom, the fund collaborated with Dutch Game Garden in organizing an intense pitch training for the participating developers. The goal for developers is to get a publishing deal or media attention for their games, so they need to be able to present their games and their company professionally and efficiently. The first two parts of the pitch training, The Roast and The Boast, were held at the Dutch Game Garden in Utrecht on 7 July and 31 August. Each part focuses on a different atmosphere and theme. This included various exercises and role-playing, with the help of experts in the Dutch games industry such as the Dutch Games Association&#x2019;s chairman Horst Streck, developer Joost van Dongen (Ronimo Games), and journalist Steven Saunders (Gamekings). <br><br>The final part of the training, The Toast, will be held on 29 September at the games showcase INDIGO. There developers will exchange their experiences at Gamescom and celebrate their successes.

		"descriptionHtml": "<strong>In 2014, Creative Industries Fund NL supported 10 young game-makers with their presentations during Gamescom Cologne. Because of the positive results that were achieved there, in 2015 the Fund is again supporting Dutch indie game developers on their journeys to Gamescom. &#x2018;Gamescom Cologne is the most important trade fair in Europe in the realm of games, an event that draws not just Europeans but people from Asia and North America as well,&#x2019; explains Marjoleine Timmer, assistant Grant Officer of Creative Industries Fund NL&#x2019;s Game Fund. &#x2018;That&#x2019;s why this fair is an ideal place for professionals in the games industry to establish useful contacts.&#x2019;</strong><br><br>The importance of Gamescom is underscored by the presence of a great many companies from the USA and the UK. &#x2018;These countries stage a considerable number of trend-setting trade fairs themselves, yet a great many companies, and they are hardly small fry, travel to Cologne for Gamescom,&#x2019; Timmer observes. &#x2018;This indicates the reach of the fair. For example, I can see stands for Steam/Valve (USA), Oculus Rift (USA), Epic Games (USA), Warner Bros. (UK office) and SEGA Europe. And it goes without saying that representatives of major platform-holders such as Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo and Apple have a presence here, too.&#x2019;<br><br><strong>Establishing contacts and catching up on news</strong><br>Gamescom has consumer as well as B2B sections. The Dutch Games Association (DGA) has for several years been organizing the Holland Pavilion, where established as well as young makers can present themselves. By participating in the Holland Pavilion, young developers can greatly expand their networks in just a few days. Ruud Koorevaar, who is presenting the game Zenzizenzic, mentions this as one of the key objectives of Gamescom, besides gaining expertise. &#x2018;It gives you the opportunity to establish myriad connections in a few days,&#x2019; Koorevaar notes. &#x2018;Just about everyone is here.&#x2019; According to Timmer, young developers can also gain a lot from conversations with more experienced participants. &#x2018;They can peek over their shoulders. But it&#x2019;s not just the international contacts that are important; the Holland Pavilion is also the place where the Dutch games developers catch up on the latest news, sharing games and ideas. This often spawns new collaborations as well.&#x2019;<br><br>Among the participants in the Holland Pavilion there are start-ups and veterans. Timmer: &apos;The latter know the tricks of the trade and boast solid networks. For young developers it is slightly trickier to strike agreements with the major companies, but when they operate under the umbrella of the Holland Pavilion they can profit from the networks of the other participants: there&#x2019;s a great solidarity within the games industry. Young developers and companies don&#x2019;t treat each other as competitors and therefore don&#x2019;t consider it a problem to share contacts. But young developers can also surf the wave in a more casual way: when major companies visit the Holland Pavilion they also take in the new games unnoticed.&#x2019;",

		"descriptionHtml": "<em>Text: Dutch Games Association</em><br><br><strong>The Dutch Games Association is proud to say that the Holland Pavilion at Gamescom 2015 was once again successful. But what do we know about the results of the Holland Pavilion in terms of business? The DGA conducted a short survey amongst exhibiting companies to get insights based on numbers about meeting expectations, value for money and media attention.</strong><br><br>The Holland Pavilion, this year a 136 m2 in booth in the b2b area of Gamescom, is organized by the Dutch Games Association in collaboration with Dutch Game Garden, Creative Industries Fund NL and Control. The setup was similar to the previous edition: commercial exhibitors rented out meeting/branding space and 10 young game makers presented their innovative game projects on INDIGO cabinets, with support of the Creative Industries Fund NL.<br><br>The result is a vibrant pavilion that is known for the innovative projects that can be found there alongside established Dutch companies like BoosterMedia, Iceberg Interactive and Paladin Studios. From the atmosphere and casual conversations it became clear that the value for money is pretty good on the Pavilion. But what do the numbers say? Exhibitors at the Holland Pavilion are more than satisfied with the Holland Pavilion. When presented with the questions if (a) the pavilion met with their expectations and (b) they would recommend the Holland Pavilion to industry colleagues, exhibitors gave an average of 9 out of 10 (n=13). Responses on the open question why people joined the Holland Pavilion reveal a similar vibe: exhibitors state that price, service and a well-organized Holland Pavilion are reasons to (re)join.<br><br><strong>Value for Money</strong><br>The main goal for companies to present at Gamescom is increasing their business by finding publishers for their games or other strategic partners. 31% of the exhibitors were there to find publishers, while another 31% was there to find strategic partners (Figure 1). In addition, exhibitors state that expanding existing business is the most important reason of their presentation (Figure 2).<br><br>When it comes to actual value for money, the results are promising: the estimated revenue that is expected by exhibitors from the leads and deals generated at the Holland Pavilion is &#x20AC; 100187,50 (n=8). When looking at the number of leads, versus the number of deals, a healthy balance between the two is visible (Figure 3).<br><br><strong>Media attention</strong><br>Exhibitors gave an average of 6,8 out of 10 for the quality and amount of media attention at the Holland Pavilion. What was particularly positive about the media coverage on the Holland Pavilion this year, were <a href=\"http://nos.nl/zoeken/?s=gamescom\" target=\"_blank\">10 articles</a> written specifically about the Dutch presence at Gamescom (both on the Holland Pavilion and booths in the B2C-area) by NOSop3, <a href=\"http://fd.nl/economie-politiek/1113993/nederlandse-gamebedrijven-roeren-zich-op-miljardenmarkt\" target=\"_blank\">one</a> with quote of the DGA by FD.nl and <a href=\"http://www.nrcq.nl/2015/08/08/dit-valt-er-op-tijdens-de-grootste-gamebeurs-van-europa\" target=\"_blank\">a general overview</a> by NRCQ. On top of that the Dutch newsradio, Radio1, covered with some live interviews with the DGA and Vertigo Games.<br><br><strong>Expanding the Dutch presence at Gamescom</strong><br>There is a clear wish at the DGA to expand the Holland Pavilion at Gamescom to at least 200 m2. The requests DGA had to turn down for the 2015 edition, combined with the fact that the start of the organization for 2016 is planned in the fall of 2015 (instead of spring &#x2018;16), makes a good case already. But there are always ways to get more out of what you do. These numbers give a first insight in what the focus of the exhibitors at the Holland Pavilion is. With these numbers, DGA can start working on the improvement of the Holland Pavilion.",

		"descriptionHtml": "<strong>SXSW Daily Report: Business or pleasure<br><br>Austin, 12 March. Yesterday was the final day of <a href=\"http://sxsw.com/interactive\" target=\"_blank\">SXSW Interactive</a>, and today the music festival starts. Geeks and start-ups are making way for the hipsters and Lady Gagas of this world, and panels are being replaced by performances. Despite the changes, the music festival is also mostly about business. For the one thing that typifies SXSW is its mixture of commerce and creativity. How do information designer Richard Vijgen and fashion designer Borre Akkersdijk view this aspect of the festival?</strong><br><br>Richard Vijgen: &quot;I&#x2019;ve been to some twenty sessions in recent days, and I even took part in one on digital heritage. It&#x2019;s my first time at SXSW, and I have to say it&#x2019;s been a remarkable experience. We&#x2019;re here under the flag of e-culture, but the festival is equally about e-commerce. There are a huge number of start-ups and small firms here who&#x2019;d like nothing better than to be bought up by Google or Facebook. At the same time, there&#x2019;s room here for critical voices. Where else but at SXSW could a hall full of people wearing Google Glasses watch a live link-up with Assange or Snowden while there&#x2019;s a promotion for the latest e-cigarette at the exit? As a European I&#x2019;m accustomed to festivals that express a moral or vision, but SXSW works differently. The programme is made up of thousands of proposals and panels about the most wide-ranging subjects. Many sessions deal with business models, but I got more enjoyment out of sessions where there was some scope for reflection. So I consciously went for subjects situated far from my practice, for example sessions about the future of farms or of health care. They threw up surprising insights. <br><br>Austin is my third stop in America. Before this I was in Los Angeles, where my installation The Deleted City is on show at the LACMA. After that I travelled to San Francisco, where I had an appointment at the Computer History Museum, which is very interested in The Deleted City. I spoke to them again here at SXSW about possibly buying the installation, so I&#x2019;ve also worked on the business side of things.&quot;<br><br>While Richard Vijgen mostly saw the Austin Convention Center from inside, fashion designer Borre spent most of his time outside on the street. He drew everyone&#x2019;s attention and comments with his eye-catching <em>BB.Suit</em>, made with the help of an innovative 3D knitting technique developed in collaboration with Eindhoven University of Technology, CRISP, Daan Spangenberg Graphics and Want.nl. The BB.Suit is fitted with GPS, Bluetooth, NFC and WiFi. If you log in on the suit you find the special SXSW 22-track playlist. Bookers and musicians can add their own numbers. <br><br>Borre: &quot;For me there&apos;s no business without pleasure. If I don&apos;t like it, I won&apos;t do it. And I think that is the key. But I also don&apos;t have to promote a product here. I&apos;m just enthusiastic about my suit, and the people in the States like enthusiasm. Everybody approaches me here. From vagrants and gangster-like types up to CEOs. The whole festival is my stage. We decided on forehand that the suit had to draw attention, and thus the story of wearable technology and ByBorre could be told. But that it would draw so much attention, we had not foreseen. I notice a shift in subject-matter now that the music part of the festival has begun. The interactive audience was really interested in the technology and the story. Now it&apos;s all about aesthetics. The 22tracklist is by the way fantastic. If we go back to the Netherlands, we are going to make a mix of all SXSW tracks.&quot;<br><br><em>Author: Joris van Ballegooijen, secretary E-culture</em><br><br><br><strong>SXSW Daily Report: Last Hijack &amp; Empire<br><br>Austin, 11 March.

The film, which I directed with Tommy Pallotta, tells the story of modern piracy from a Somali perspective.&quot;<br><br>In addition to the documentary, Submarine Channel has produced an interactive version for online environments in which viewers can alternate between Western and Somali perspectives.

Empire examines the traces of Dutch colonialism. For this project Jongsma and O&#x2019;Neill travelled 200,000 kilometres around the world in four years. Empire was filmed in ten countries and traces the routes of the Dutch East India Company and the Dutch West India Company.<br><br>O&#x2019;Neill: &quot;We literally lived inside the project. In 2010 we left everything behind us, organized a give-away party, cancelled our rent and headed off in search of stories with a human scale.&quot;<br><br>Jongsma: &quot;Empire takes on various forms. It is in the first place a museum installation in which three stories are told at the same time in a spatial setting. The stories are linked in the same way that, for example, Ghana, Indonesia and Suriname are linked by history. In essence, viewers navigate with their feet and choose which stories to follow. We&#x2019;ve also made an online adaptation of the installation in which viewers can choose which side of the story they want to follow by turning or rotating the image. An Empire book has also been published.&quot;<br><br><a href=\"http://www.empireproject.eu\" target=\"_blank\">www.empireproject.eu</a><br><br><em>Author: Joris van Ballegooijen, secretary E-culture</em><br><br><br><strong>SXSW Daily Report: Chordify &amp; Streamwatchr<br><br>Austin, 10 March.

Chordify extracts chord schemes from songs and Streamwatchr monitors what people are listening to around the world on music streaming services.</strong><br><br>Chordify is presenting itself at the SXSW Trade Show with a booth featuring a big screen that displays its online application. Interested visitors can select a number, the URL of the YouTube film is then inserted, and the chords roll out automatically. Co-founder Bas de Haas, a former conservatory student, plays along to all numbers on a guitar.<br>Bas de Haas: &quot;I&#x2019;m actually the personification of a crossover. Apart from my music experience I have a technical background. The algorithm for Chordify comes from my dissertation.&quot;<br><br>Dion ten Heggeler (co-founder of Chordify): &quot;The public at SXSW is fantastic. The people who come here understand technology and are really open to new applications. Music is of course also a very good way of attracting attention, although we&#x2019;re not allowed to go above 85 decibels here. This morning we officially announced our collaboration with Deezer, one of the biggest music-streaming services. Chordify is perfectly integrated with Deezer. As you listen to a track you&#x2019;re just one click away from actually playing the number.&quot;<br><br>From Deezer it&#x2019;s but a small step to Streamwatchr. On the Streamwatchr website, launched on the first day of SXSW, you can follow which numbers people are listening to around the world at any exact moment. The algorithm developed by Wouter Weerkamp, a researcher at the University of Amsterdam, takes information from Twitter and links it to existing numbers on YouTube. The elegant interface features a grid of squares that are album covers. If someone posts a Tweet about a number, the square turns around and the site is updated. Streamwatchr currently receives some half a million tweets a day. <br><br>Wouter Weerkamp: &quot;The aim of Streamwatchr is to allow people to engage with new music in a very direct manner. You can choose from the categories &#x2018;now&#x2019;, &#x2018;hot&#x2019; and &#x2018;unexpected&#x2019;. What&#x2019;s more, Streamwatchr is interesting for the music industry too. In the future we want to connect Streamwatchr directly to Spotify or Deezer. We made contact with Spotify here at SXSW during a developers&#x2019; meeting. The programme for tomorrow includes a meeting with the head of music at Twitter. A link with Chordify is possibly on the cards too.&quot;<br><br><em> Author: Joris van Ballegooijen, secretary E-culture</em> <br><br><strong><a href=\"http://chordify.net\" target=\"_blank\">chordify.net</a></strong>.<br><strong><a href=\"http://streamwatchr.com\" target=\"_blank\">streamwatchr.com</a></strong><br><br><br><strong>SXSW Daily report : Blender - Trade Show<br><br>Austin, 9 March. With the opening of the Trade Show, the South by Southwest festival is now in full swing. The Trade Show is the domain of almost three hundred innovative firms and start-ups, among them the Blender Institute from the Netherlands, internationally renowned for its open source animation productions. The opening of the Trade Show coincides with the launch of the campaign for Blender&#x2019;s new Gooseberry animation project.</strong><br><br>Ton Roosendaal (producer Gooseberry): &#x2018;The feature film we&#x2019;re going to make is a collaborative project involving twelve young, independent animation studios from all over the world. Each of the studios produces part of the film in its own style. Esther Wouda, who previously worked on the script for Sintel, came up with the idea for the fairly absurdist scenario about a sheep called Michel who wants to lead a more interesting life. A vendor makes a Faustian bargain with the sheep and allows him to experience many different lives.&#x2019; <br><br>&#x2018;Over the past days and nights we&#x2019;ve worked unbelievably hard on the launch of the online crowdfunding campaign on <a href=\"http://gooseberry.blender.org\" target=\"_blank\">gooseberry.blender.org</a>. The aim of the campaign is to find 10,000 supporters for the film. We offer supporters a subscription to the Blender Cloud so that they can follow the production process live. The Trade Show is a perfect podium because everybody comes to us and the public at SXSW interactive is well informed. Many people know Blender and are familiar with the principles of open production. It takes just 10,000 people to change the film industry.&#x2019;<br><br><em> Author: Joris van Ballegooijen, secretary E-culture</em> <br><br><br><strong>SXSW Daily report: Pauline van Dongen - Accelerator<br><br>Austin, 8 March. Today is Pauline van Dongen&#x2019;s day. Selected from five hundred submissions, she has an opportunity today to make a two-minute pitch of her Wearable Solar project to a jury of CEOs, potential investors and technology experts. </strong><br><br>In the prestigious Wearable Technology Accelerator programme at SXSW, <a href=\"http://paulinevandongen.nl/\" target=\"_blank\">Pauline van Dongen</a> is competing against seven start-ups from Canada and the US, three of whom will go through to the final. The Wearable Solar project appeals to everybody&#x2019;s imagination. The incorporation of solar cells in coats and dresses enables Wearable Solar to generate power through clothing. An average smartphone is charged in two hours in the Texan sun. <br><br>Wearable Solar is currently at the R&amp;D phase in which Van Dongen is working with solar energy specialist Gert Jan Jongerden and Christiaan Holland from the HAN University of Applied Sciences. Van Dongen creates wonderful design for the haute couture market, but is that enough to convince American investors? Or are they more interested in the production costs and profit margins? <br><br>Van Dongen: &#x2018;You are given a personal coach in the SXSW Accelerator programme. The jury assesses start-ups according to creativity and market potential, and whether the product improves the world. When I applied for the Accelerator pitch half a year ago I described Wearable Solar as a project, but now I&#x2019;ll have to present it as a product. Serial production is something for the future. The main reason I&#x2019;m here is to find potential technical partners. My aim is to integrate technology into clothing in such a way that they merge fully. Technology must contribute to expression, and for me the design must be more than functional. Increasing the scale of Wearable Technology designs is the biggest challenge. Even so, I expect to put the first products on the market within the next year and a half or two.&#x2019; <br><br>The presentation goes well and Van Dongen wins over the audience. And even though it&#x2019;s been raining the whole day in Austin, at 6 p.m. the jury chairwoman Laurie Segall saves the situation for Wearable Solar by announcing that Pauline van Dongen is through to the <a href=\"http://sxsw.com/interactive/news/2014/accelerator-round-2-finalists-announced-startups-are-making-waves-sxsw\" target=\"_blank\">final</a>!<br><br><em> Author: Joris van Ballegooijen, secretary E-culture</em> <br><br>Pauline van Dongen is also supported by the Grant Programme for Talent Development.<br><br><br><strong>SXSW Daily report: Digital Dreams &#x2013; Gaming Expo<br><br>Austin, 7 March. The city is slowly filling with festival visitors and roads are being closed off. Stands are being built everywhere to the sound of music plays. The first barbecues are being lit. Just outside the centre lies the Palmer Events Center, the venue for the first big show of the <a href=\"http://sxsw.com/trade-shows/gaming\" target=\"_blank\">SXSW Gaming Expo</a> interactive programme. </strong><br><br>With the doors due to open in half an hour, the boys from Digital Dreams are putting the finishing touches to their booth at this international music/film/interactive festival. They&#x2019;re presenting Metrico, an innovative game in which players navigate through a landscape built up of infographics generated in real time on the basis of the movements of players. What are Digital Dreams expectations of SXSW?<br><br>Geert Nellen (game designer and art director at Digital Dreams): &#x2018;We&#x2019;re ready for it. Yesterday Sony delivered the three Vita Play stations for our presentation to a local game developer in Austin. It&#x2019;s really fine to have local contacts. Game developers in Austin are self-made and self-organized. It&#x2019;s a lively scene. Through them we were able to find a cheap place to stay, and they keep us posted about parties and special events in the evening.&#x2019;<br><br>Thijmen Bink (technical director of Digital Dreams): &#x2018;We want to offer expo visitors a relaxed gaming experience. The booth is open and contains three beanbags. You have to take a little time to play Metrico. The level of the developers walking around here is high. It&#x2019;s hectic, but the mood is relaxed. What works well is SXSW social, a very easy way to get in touch with interesting people.&#x2019; <br><br>Roy van de Mortel (level designer at Digital Dreams): &#x2018;Indie and commercial games are all mixed together at this expo. The Gaming Expo is relatively new aspect of SXSW, so you can see that the organizers are still figuring things out. After Austin we&#x2019;re heading to the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco, which is even bigger than SXSW in terms of games. But because we&#x2019;re part of the Interactive programme here, SXSW has offered us a chance to show our stuff to a much wider audience and press. For us, SXSW will be a success if we manage to reach the mainstream American media with Metrico.&#x2019; <br><br>On Monday 11 March, Digital Dreams is presenting at the Dutch Base within the framework of the Spotlight on Holland programme. The official worldwide release of Metrico by Sony is scheduled for 12 March.<br><br><em> Author: Joris van Ballegooijen, secretary E-culture</em>            \n        </div>\n        <div class=\"imco-intext imco toload noafter nocap\"><div class=\"sizer\" style=\"padding-top:64%;\"></div><div class=\"inr\"><img data-tst=\"64\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" alt=\"Empireweb.jpg\" title=\"Reports SXSW 2014\" data-ratio=\"0.64021164021164\" data-owidth=\"567\" data-src=\"http://content.stimuleringsfonds.nl/files/pro/i_3502/Empireweb.jpg\"></div></div><div class=\"imco-intext imco toload noafter nocap\"><div class=\"sizer\" style=\"padding-top:61%;\"></div><div class=\"inr\"><img data-tst=\"61\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" alt=\"Chordifyweb.jpg\" title=\"Reports SXSW 2014\" data-ratio=\"0.61728395061728\" data-owidth=\"567\" data-src=\"http://content.stimuleringsfonds.nl/files/pro/i_3502/Chordifyweb.jpg\"></div></div><div class=\"imco-intext imco toload noafter nocap\"><div class=\"sizer\" style=\"padding-top:57%;\"></div><div class=\"inr\"><img data-tst=\"57\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" alt=\"Gooseberryweb.jpg\" title=\"Reports SXSW 2014\" data-ratio=\"0.57142857142857\" data-owidth=\"567\" data-src=\"http://content.stimuleringsfonds.nl/files/pro/i_3502/Gooseberryweb.jpg\"></div></div><div class=\"imco-intext imco toload noafter nocap\"><div class=\"sizer\" style=\"padding-top:54%;\"></div><div class=\"inr\"><img data-tst=\"54\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" alt=\"PaulineSXSWweb.jpg\" title=\"Reports SXSW 2014\" data-ratio=\"0.54497354497354\" data-owidth=\"567\" data-src=\"http://content.stimuleringsfonds.nl/files/pro/i_3502/PaulineSXSWweb.jpg\"></div></div><div class=\"imco-intext imco toload noafter nocap\"><div class=\"sizer\" style=\"padding-top:65%;\"></div><div class=\"inr\"><img data-tst=\"65\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" alt=\"DigitalDreamsweb.jpg\" title=\"Reports SXSW 2014\" data-ratio=\"0.65432098765432\" data-owidth=\"567\" data-src=\"http://content.stimuleringsfonds.nl/files/pro/i_3502/DigitalDreamsweb.jpg\"></div></div>        \n        \t<div class=\"slink-con\">\n\t\t<div class=\"slink-upper clrfx\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"sh-b\">\n\t\t\t\t<a class=\"sh-link tw-sh\" title=\"twitter share\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Reports+SXSW+2014 http%3A%2F%2Fstimuleringsfonds.nl%2Fen%2Fgrants_issued%2Freports_sxsw_2014%2F3502%2F via @StimuleerFonds\"> </a>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"sh-b\">\n\t\t\t\t<a class=\"sh-link fb-sh\" title=\"facebook share\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fstimuleringsfonds.nl%2Fen%2Fgrants_issued%2Freports_sxsw_2014%2F3502%2F\"> </a>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"sh-b\">\n\t\t\t\t<a class=\"sh-link ln-sh\" title=\"linkedin share\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fstimuleringsfonds.nl%2Fen%2Fgrants_issued%2Freports_sxsw_2014%2F3502%2F&amp;title=Reports+SXSW+2014\"> </a>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"sh-b sh-l\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a title=\"share link\" class=\"l-sh\" href=\"#\"> </a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"l-sh-txt h5\">share link</span>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"sh-b sh-p listprint\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a title=\"print\" class=\"p-sh\" href=\"#\"> </a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"p-sh-txt h5\">print</span>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t            \n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"slink-lower\">  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<input class=\"dlink-input\" type=\"text\" value=\"http://stimuleringsfonds.nl/en/grants_issued/reports_sxsw_2014/3502/\" readonly>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\n\t    \n    </div>",

		"descriptionHtml": "<strong>During the Dutch Design Week, which runs from 18 to 26 October, the Creative Industries Fund NL is showcasing young talent. The exhibition In No Particular Order displays work by young creative professionals who in 2013/2014 received a year-long grant from the Creative Industries Fund NL. The exhibition focuses on recent work, but also provides insights about the current generation of creatives who are active in the fields of design, architecture and e-culture.</strong><br><br>What makes someone a talent? How is talent moulded? That is the pivotal question addressed by this exhibition at the Schellensfabriek in Eindhoven. Factors that play a role in the shaping of talent &#x2013; equipment, production processes, influential books, role models and correspondence &#x2013; were investigated and amassed for this presentation. Do people acquire talent through practical experience or are they born with it? &#x2018;With this exhibition I wanted to separate the notion of talent from its aura of mystery and dissect the actual qualities and other factors that contribute to the shaping of talent,&#x2019; explains curator Agata Jaworska.<br><br><strong>New work and interpreting current trends</strong><br>In No Particular Order presents work by individual talents, but also reveals trends and interrelationships. Sketchbooks, personal libraries, studios, working methods and ideas are combined to provide a surprising insight into this young generation of creatives.

		"descriptionHtml": "<strong>Gamescom report #3: I saw a visitor wiping away a tear.<br><br>Participating in Gamescom can be highly productive for these young, start-up independent game studios: finding a publisher for the game, seeking partners for ongoing development, networking or attempting to get some of the hundreds of journalists who are attending the fair to play your game.</strong><br><br>Nick Aarts from Lionade Games: &quot;This morning we&#x2019;ve already managed to arrange meetings with publishers, this afternoon we&#x2019;re sitting down with Sony. Visitors are already calling our game <a href=\"http://stimuleringsfonds.nl/en/grants_issued/2164/gamescom_2014_cologne_check_in_knock_out\">Check In, Knock Out</a> a developers&#x2019; hit and the guy from Sony is going to play it with his colleagues.&quot;<br><br>At Gamescom everyone is welcome to play the selected games at the Holland Pavilion stand. Roel Ezendam from Ragesquid: &quot;<a href=\"http://stimuleringsfonds.nl/en/grants_issued/2160/gamescom_cologne_2014_action_henk\">Action Henk</a> seems to be cheering up visitors to the expo. The game is colourful and it&#x2019;s easy to pick it up.&quot; <br><br>However, there are also games with a more serious note: <a href=\"http://stimuleringsfonds.nl/en/grants_issued/2159/gamescom_2014_cologne_fragments_of_him\">Fragments of Him</a> by SassyBot Studio is about coping with bereavement. &quot;Someone from Dutch Cowboys walked past and actually wasn&#x2019;t keen to play to game when he heard what the subject matter was,&quot; says game designer Tino van der Kraan. &quot;But this game still intrigued him and he decided to try it, and at a certain point I noticed that he had to wipe away a tear. The game is moving, as it&#x2019;s about exploring empathy and emotion, and it&#x2019;s only when you play the game that you discover how it affects you. It&#x2019;s something totally different to the explosions and flying limbs that you see plenty of in the games here at Gamescom. There&#x2019;s also plenty of press and media: The Huffington Post and the Dutch newspaper Nederlands Dagblad already passed by this morning.&quot;<br><br><br><strong>Gamescom report #2: As an indie, do something different<br><br>An early afternoon session at Gamescom allowed participants in the Holland Pavilion to pick the brains of experienced developers about how to pitch their games.</strong><br><br>The people at this gathering last Tuesday afternoon included Adriel Wallick (<a href=\"http://msminotaur.com/\" target=\"_blank\">MsMinotaur</a>), renowned for trainjam and other games, Matthew Handrahan from <a href=\"http://www.gamesindustry.biz\" target=\"_blank\">gamesindustry.biz</a>, J.W. Nijman of the game studio <a href=\"http://www.vlambeer.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Vlambeer</a> and the team from Digital Dreams, who are launching their game <a href=\"http://stimuleringsfonds.nl/nl/toekenningen/2174/metrico_voorheen_fyi\">Metrico</a> on PS Vita.<br><br>The most important tip from this Q&amp;A session organized by the Creative Industries Fund NL was actually right in front of our noses: &quot;As an indie, do something different! Don&#x2019;t use your creativity just for your game; apply it to the way you present it as well. And be over-proactive and always bring stroopwafels!&quot;<br><br><em>Let&apos;s see what fruits Gamescom will produce!</em><br><br><br><strong>Gamescom Report#1: Adriaan de Jongh about Bounden<br><br>Eric Bartelson, co-founder and Editor-in-Chief of <a href=\"http://control-online.nl/\" target=\"_blank\">Control Magazine</a>, attended the talk by Adriaan de Jongh (Game Oven) during the Independent Games Summit symposium that preceded the Gamescom fair (13&#x2013;17 August) in Cologne. Game Oven is one of the ten studios being supported by the Creative Industries Fund NL to give a presentation during Gamescom.</strong><br><br>By Eric Bartelson<br><br>Adriaan de Jongh of Game Oven knows what he&#x2019;s talking about when it comes to challenging the audience to invent new genres. With Game Oven he has certainly enriched the world of games with &#x2018;phone dancing&#x2019;, &#x2018;people touching&#x2019; and &#x2018;friend chaining&#x2019;.<br><br>According to De Jongh, your best chance of devising a new genre is in what he terms the &#x2018;game mechanic genre&#x2019;. &#x201C;Here a smart game mechanic can already count as a new genre,&#x201D; says De Jongh. &#x201C;Take Fingle. We were the first to make a finger-touch game, and now you can see all kinds of rip-offs.&#x201D; Thanks to his experience as a game developer, he now distinguishes six factors that contribute to the development of original games.<br><br><strong>Vision</strong> &quot;You must have a strong vision, because good game mechanics reinforce a vision. How to come up with a solid vision? Well, it&#x2019;s different for everyone. For Salvador Dali, for example, it was the moment between waking and sleeping. That&#x2019;s why he often sat in an armchair with a plate on his lap and a heavy metal key in his hand. If he fell asleep then he dropped the key, which then clattered noisily onto the plate. That was the moment he woke up with a jolt, immediately got up, and produced his surrealist paintings.&quot; De Jongh says that everybody has to search for their own inspiring place, because that is the spot where your vision takes shape.<br><br><strong>Make weird shit</strong> &#x201C;Try everything. Don&#x2019;t be led by preconceived ideas that something isn&#x2019;t or cannot be fun. Make everything that comes to mind. That is how you&#x2019;ll discover which mechanic it closest to your vision&quot;, De Jongh argues, &quot;often with unexpected results. I call it Adriaan de Jongh&#x2019;s Orbital Approach.&#x201D;<br><br><strong>Throw everything away</strong> You have to dare, but it is really refreshing to throw away ideas and designs. &#x201C;Artists have less difficulty with throwing away work if it isn&#x2019;t up to scratch. Programmers, by contrast, prefer not to. It does mean that weeks of work are destroyed in one go. There should be some way in which programmers can also sketch with code in just a couple of hours.&#x201D;<br><br><strong>Prototype until it works</strong> &#x201C;I make a prototype every day,&#x201D; says De Jongh. But that alone is not enough. &#x201C;You have to get as many different people as possible to play it and you have to open to criticism. All the criticism, no matter how harsh or stupid it is, is justified. Learn from it.&#x201D;<br><br><strong>Stop in time</strong> If a game that you&#x2019;re developing doesn&#x2019;t succeed, then don&#x2019;t hesitate to stop. Don&#x2019;t spend too long lingering, but simply pull the plug. That may be a severe decision, but De Jongh has reassuring words: &#x201C;Stopping isn&#x2019;t failing.&#x201D;<br><br><strong>Gather the right people</strong> &quot;Surround yourself with the right people. Are they open to experimentation? Do they appreciate your opinion? A good team is unmissable.&quot;",

This year a number of well-known labels, young and established designers and collectives from Dutch soil presented their work at Via Tortona and Via Savona. In addition, the busy Spazio Rossana Orlandi gallery and shop is a showcase for many designers, with it&apos;s audience of international journalists, interior designers and interested visitors. Five of the twenty-two projects supported through the <a href=\"http://stimuleringsfonds.nl/en/grants/grant_programmes/grant_programme_for_internationalization/\">Grant Programme for Internationalization</a> or the <a href=\"http://stimuleringsfonds.nl/en/grants/grant_programmes/grant_programme_for_design/\">Grant Programme for Design</a> had their presentations at these two locations.</strong><br><br><strong>Withering Tableware<br>Studio Maarten Kolk &amp; Guus Kusters</strong><br><em>Via M. Bandello 14</em><br>Traditionally, paintwork on fine china is applied by hand, making it a labour-intensive and thus costly craft. Kolk and Kusters developed glazing recipes that require craftsmen not to paint the crockery directly, but rather, to paint the mould before the product is cast. Several copies of one painting can therefore be made. In commission of product distributor Thomas Eijck the designers showed this china in Spazio Rossana Orlandi.<br><br><strong>Stamppot<br>BCXSY</strong><br><em>Via M. Bandello 14</em><br>Initiated by the Kazerne Lab in collaboration with Twinkelbel, Stamppot consists of a series of ceramic objects related to tableware. While referring to typical Dutch vegetables, the forms remain amorphous and are designed to be interpreted.<br><br><strong>Meet &amp; Matter<br>Tuttobene</strong> <br><em>Via Tortona 31</em><br>Dutch design platform Tuttobene presented over 20 designers with their newest projects in the heart of Zona Tortona. This year&#x2019;s show emphasized encounters between designers and their public, as the personal stories behind an object shape the personal relationship one has with that object. Tuttobene has been organizing group presentations for talented and innovative designers during the Salone del Mobile since 2004.<br><br><strong>Shut the Door, Have a Seat<br>DvanDirk</strong><br><em>Via Tortona 31</em><br>Dirk Ploos van Amstel reinterprets everyday moments by re-imagining activities like playing, swinging, sleeping and eating. In his design practice he focuses on rendering the invisible visible while keeping user experience central to the creative process. In Milan he presented a door handle called <em>Shut the Door, Have a Seat</em> and a rocking bench called <em>Thanks, No Sugar</em>.<br><br><strong>Cream LAB<br>Cream PR</strong><br><em>Via Savona 53</em><br>At Via Savona Cream PR presented the latest products by Dutch designers and brands Alex de Witte, Cor Unum, Coqoon, Dutch Originals/Gispen, Gjalt producties, JSPR, Lolo Palazzo, MOMIQ, Winde Rienstra and 4Dreams. Cream LAB connects the media and designers during this temporary platform.<br><br><br><strong>Report Milan Design Week #2: SaloneSatellite, Centro &amp; Garibaldi<br><br>The international design fair Salone del Mobile is accomplished and most Dutch designers are back in the Netherlands to provide their newly made contacts a follow-up. The Creative Industries Fund NL supported twenty-two presentations of designers and collectives in Milan. Eight of them showed their work at the centre of the city, around Garibaldi station or at the SaloneSatellite, the satellite exhibition of the Salone. All of these projects were made possible by the <a href=\"http://stimuleringsfonds.nl/en/grants/grant_programmes/grant_programme_for_internationalization/\">Grant Programme for Internationalization</a> or the <a href=\"http://stimuleringsfonds.nl/en/grants/grant_programmes/grant_programme_for_design/\">Grant Programme for Design</a>.</strong><br><br><strong>Formafantasma<br>De Natura Fossilium</strong><br><em>Via Clerici 5</em><br>In Palazzo Clerici Studio Formafantasma presented their newest objects out of the project around Mount Etna. In De Natura Fossilium the designers investigated the cultures surrounding this particularly Sicilian mountain. Mount Etna they say &apos;is a mine without miners: it excavates itself to expose raw materials&apos;. This project brings both the landscape and the forces of nature together as facilities for production.<br><br><strong>Marjan van Aubel<br>Current Table</strong><br><em>a.o. SaloneSatellite Paviljoen 13-15 Fiera</em><br>Current Table is a piece of furniture that functions as a source of energy. It gathers and harvests energy from daylight with dye-sensitized solar cells, charging your appliance while you use the table for reading a book or writing emails. This makes Current Table a piece of furniture that harvests energy indoors, combining utility and aesthetics in an everyday object.<br><br><strong>Laura Lynn Jansen &amp; Thomas Vailly<br>CaCO3 stoneware</strong><br><em>Via Pastrengo 12</em><br>Together with scientists, geologists and craftsmen, Laura Lynn Jansen and Thomas Vailly studied the geological process of sedimentation in the Auvergne, a volcanic region in France. Inspired by how stalactites grow, they left 3D-printed structures to petrify for weeks in specially chosen thermo-mineral springs, thus giving birth to geologically engineered stoneware - fossils of a new kind.<br><br><strong>LOW MOTION<br>Thomas Eurlings, Jesse Visser, Geke Lensink, Youasme Measyou</strong><br><em>Corso Como 9</em><br>Low Motion fuses conviction, emotion and design. What unites this collective of designers is the aspiration to make products that transcend time and become part of your life. This requires quality in design, responsible choices of materials and production, and a clear and personal signature.<br><br><strong>Bart Hess &amp; MU<br>Work With Me People</strong><br><em>Via Clerici 5</em><br>In this presentation in Palazzo Clerici, visitors are invited to take their place at an assembly line, where they work together on a collection of couture textiles designed by Bart Hess. This labour-intensive project would be impossible without the obliging hands of &#x2018;volunteers&apos;, which is an aspect Hess brings up for discussion, cheerfully although not without irony.<br><br><strong>Green Island<br>aMAZElab</strong><br><em>a.o. Garibaldi Station</em><br>This project arose from the need to instil in citizens a sense of greater harmony between urban fabric and natural space. In the twelfth edition of LANDSCAPING: Dutch Design for a New City Garden, botanists, designers and landscape artists including Piet Oudolf, Floris Wubben and a group of Dutch beekeepers were invited to rethink a new concept for urban gardens.<br><br><strong>ledwork<br>Interactive Lightforms</strong><br><em>SaloneSatellite Paviljoen 13-15 Fiera</em><br>ledwork are highly tangible lights that respond to touch and movement. Connected together, they form a swarm of lights in which new patterns constantly emerge. ledwork&#x2019;s dynamic presence challenges the concept of light.<br><br><strong>Maarten Baas<br>BAAS IS IN TOWN</strong><br><em>Via Zecca Vecchia 3 </em><br>Maarten Baas, in partnership with Ventura Projects and 5VIE, showed various new designs, collections and collaborations. For this big presentation in Milan Baas, together with Theatre Group De Kwekerij, presented all of his objects in the context of a circus.<br><br><br><strong>Report Milan Design Week #1: Zona Lambrate<br><br>During the Salone del Mobile in Milan Dutch design is omnipresent in the Lambrate district.

Bekking is showing the physical outcome of this research using this Brain_manufacturing design method.<br><br><strong>REVIVE<br>By rENs en DESSO</strong><br><em>Via Massimiano 23</em><br>Designer couple rENs (Renee Mennen and Stefanie van Keijsteren) presented a new collection of rugs called REVIVE, together with carpet manufacturer DESSO. Carpet collections that run out of date are recoloured manually in a huge paint-bath with the signal colour red. The interaction between the yarns and red dye results in endless colour gradations, giving each rug an identity of its own and a second life.<br><br><strong>Folded Lampshade<br>Pepe Heykoop</strong><br><em>Via dei Canzi 19</em><br>There is a community of 700 people living in a slum in Mumbai, India. They are uneducated, have limited skills, and earn on average 1 euro a day. Heykoop, together with the Tiny Miracles foundation, is working to break their poverty cycle by 2020. Folded Lampshade, presented at Lambrate, is one of the products he makes with them.<br><br><strong>Nowruz Rituals<br>Hozan Zangana</strong><br><em>Via dei Canzi 19</em><br>For the tradition surrounding the Persian New Year celebration on March 21, Hozan Zangana has created a contemporary Haft Sin table setting, bearing seven traditional items that start with the letter S.

These designers presented their projects in the Holland Pavilion. Bruno Vermeersch (Jacques &amp; Andr&#xE9;) designed the pavilion as a plaza, a meeting place with lampposts and benches that would allow the public to mingle and talk about the exhibited projects and the theme.</strong><br><br>The theme of this year&#x2019;s festival was &#x2018;Well-Aged Life, Well-Balanced Design&#x2019;, as South Korea is also contending with a greying population. The festival attracted more than 100,000 visitors and there was plenty of footfall through the Holland Pavilion. The conversations between the designers and the public with the aid of interpreters proved to be a valuable experience. &#x2018;Talking with people about the theme is in itself an important experience for my project&#x2019;s development,&#x2019; notes Juliette Huygen, who presented her project about euthanasia. &#x2018;Initially I didn&#x2019;t really know what to expect and I was nervous about how people would react. It turned out that many people are familiar with euthanasia and are interested in having an open conversation about it.&#x2019;<br><br>On Saturday, 29 November a group of senior citizens from the Gangnam Senior Plaza visited the pavilion. This was a highlight for the designers, as this is the target group for their projects. The senior citizens were enthusiastic. Also the project by Michou Nanon de Bruijn caught the attraction of the seniors. The group already talked about the costs of a ticket for the BrainTrain and if the train could drive in South Korea. Julia van Zanten discussed her Protective Underwear project with an elderly Korean woman, who emotionally indicated that she believed such projects would truly allow her to grow old more happily. <br><br><strong>Interaction in projects for senior citizens</strong> <br>Jules van den Langenberg seized the chance to play bingo with visiting senior citizens, using his specially designed bingo set. The lamps by Studio Toer, which react to movement and sound, were a hit with the Korean public. &#x2018;With our designs we want to ensure that objects which are usually static can display autonomous behaviour. We therefore focus on interaction and the creation of a dynamic atmosphere. Many of our projects come about because we explore things in a playful manner,&#x2019; Studio Toer&#x2019;s Castor Bours and Wouter Widdershoven explain. &#x2018;Our lamps bring vitality into the home, showing that furniture can provide company, for single elderly people, for example.&#x2019;<br>By and large the festival was more of a consumer fair where businesses marketed their newest gadgets. This setting nevertheless presented opportunities for the designers to stand out. Many visitors passed by because the pavilion conveyed the festival&#x2019;s theme so clearly. The Dutch approach also attracted media attention, with various designers giving interviews for magazines and TV, and there were plenty of requests for press packs. <br><br><em>The Holland Pavilion was made possible by the Creative Industries Fund NL, the Dutch Embassy in South Korea, the Design House and the East West Education Center.</em><br><br><br><br><strong>Report #1 Seoul Design Week: An Introduction to Heritage, Crafts and Materials<br><br>In the context of the Open Call for Participation in the Seoul Design Festival, a group of 10 Dutch designers was selected to travel to South Korea last week. In advance of presenting their products and concepts during the Seoul Design Festival, these designers participated in a range of enlightening activities.</strong><br><br>Monday the 24th of November marked the start of the official programme for the Dutch designers in South Korea, two days before the opening of the Seoul Design Festival (26&#x2013;30 November). The first part of the programme involved an informative meeting about heritage and crafts. &#x2018;In order to work in a country where progress and innovation are paramount it is important to know how that country has evolved,&#x2019; explains Jasmijn van Weenen, Grant Officer for the Creative Industries Fund NL&#x2019;s Internationalization Programme and Project Manager within the Fund. &#x2018;We therefore made a visit to the Korea Cultural Heritage Foundation, a government institution that is concerned with the preservation of Korean heritage and passing it down to future generations. It is devoted to introducing more people to tangible and intangible heritage. The institution also strives to inform a broader international public about centuries-old traditions and working methods.&apos;<br><br><strong>Workshop about Korean <em>hanji</em> paper and the traditional <em>ieum</em> carpentry technique</strong><br>After the guided tour of the Korea Cultural Heritage Foundation&#x2019;s exhibition space, the group gained insight into a diversity of traditional Korean production techniques, materials and processes. A workshop supervised by artisans allowed the designers to learn about and experiment with Korean heritage and historic work processes. The designers learnt how to work with Korean <em>hanji</em>, a paper produced from mulberry trees, and how to manufacture objects using the traditional <em>ieum</em> carpentry technique, which characteristically uses no nails. With this technique the various components dovetail into one another, as found in traditional <em>hanok</em> houses.<br><br><strong>Visit to an old people&#x2019;s home in the Gangnam quarter</strong><br>The theme of this year&#x2019;s Seoul Design Festival is &#x2018;Well-Aged Life, Well-Balanced Design&#x2019;. South Korea is also being confronted with exponential growth in the population aged 65 years and above. The visit to the Gangnam Senior Plaza care home was the second part of the programme for the designers. &#x2018;&#x201C;Healthy Aging, Active Aging, Productive Aging, Integrative Aging&#x201D; is Gangnam Senior Plaza&#x2019;s motto,&#x2019; Van Weenen reports. &#x2018;Besides offering creative courses, the centre also provides medical care, inexpensive meals and even a dating service for senior citizens. Voluntary work is a mainstay of Gangnam Senior Plaza, hierdoor so that residents can give something back to society, feel they are useful, and continue to utilize their knowledge and many years of experience.&#x2019;<br><br>After a short introduction and a presentation about the various activities in the centre, the group was given a guided tour of the six-storey building. &#x2018;The centre was light and spacious, and the facilities were excellent. The atmosphere there was relaxed and cheerful. The centre&#x2019;s focus is to ensure that growing older is not detrimental to your quality of life. This ties in with &#x2018;The Medicine Called Fun&#x2019; project that Jules van den Langenberg is presenting during the Seoul Design Festival: How can you re-instil pleasure into the lives of senior citizens? The &#x2018;NewGrey&#x2019; project by Michou Nanon de Bruijn also sketches various utopian worlds where senior citizens can continue to lead a worthwhile life. &#x2018;A visit to the Gangnam Senior Plaza provided our group with useful insights into how we might find alternative ways of approaching ageing people, how you can continue to utilize skills and qualities, and how we can spend the later phases of our lives in happiness.&#x2019;",

According to the SXSW app his session is &#x2018;Hot&#x2019;, and that is obvious. The hall is full, even though former US Vice President Al Gore is giving a talk just 200 metres away. Van Mensvoort presented his <em>In Vitro Meat Cookbook</em> with recipes for lab-grown meat, Nano wine, the technosphere concept and more with great flair. He mentions all the examples with which Next Nature has sparked debate about new technology and potential applications.

Whereas Next Nature&#x2019;s concepts are still speculative, Van Dongen is taking the initial steps towards realization. As a fashion designer Van Dongen occupies a unique position among the Dutch doctoral students. In her presentation she endorses the urgency of designing items that relate new technologies to the movement and flexibility of the body. One step which Van Dongen believes is essential is making 3D-printed clothing wearable, with which she hopes to be able to offer a counter tegengeluid to the waste and pollution in fashion. The presentation transports the audience into the challenging and unexplored world of wearables, and what you are confronted with when working with these materials. Van Dongen also called on designers from various disciplines to cooperate and devise a shared vocabulary. It&#x2019;s obvious that we&#x2019;re not there yet, but Pauline van Dongen is determined to call the technology into question and to develop concepts for wearable and accessible fashion.<br><br>The sessions by Pauline van Dongen and Koert van Mensvoort were two of the 16 projects that were supported in the context of the <a href=\"http://stimuleringsfonds.nl/en/latest/news/open_call_for_participation_in_south_by_southwest_2015/\">Open Call: Participation in South by Southwest 2015</a>.",

		"descriptionHtml": "<strong>A relatively new component of the Texan technology festival South by Southwest (SXSW) is the Game Expo: a three-day fair from 13 to 15 March where games are presented in every shape and size. The fair takes place in a large hall on the far side of the Rio Grande in Austin and entrance is free, so besides being an event for the industry it is also a big attraction for Texan families. Board games, indie games, bigger releases &#x2013; you can play everything here.</strong><br><br>Five Dutch game studios are presenting themselves at the SXSW Game Expo with the financial support of the Creative Industries Fund NL: Ragesquid (<a href=\"http://stimuleringsfonds.nl/en/latest/grants_issued/ragesquid_action_henk/\">Action Henk</a>), Ludomotion and Fourcelabs (<a href=\"http://stimuleringsfonds.nl/en/latest/grants_issued/evermore/\">Era of Wonders</a>), Self Made Miracle (<a href=\"http://stimuleringsfonds.nl/en/latest/grants_issued/self_made_miracle_penarium/\">Penarium</a>) and Game Oven (<a href=\"http://stimuleringsfonds.nl/en/latest/grants_issued/game_oven_studios_bounden/\">Bounden</a>). Anyone walking around here will encounter a marvellous mix of game developers, festival visitors and families with loads of kids. According to Adriaan de Jongh of Game Oven, it is this latter aspect that is so special for a game fair: &#x2018;The great thing about this fair is that you meet plenty of consumers. Lots of people want to play the games, lots of people by the game on the spot, and it provides valuable feedback.&#x2019; Joris Dormans of Ludomotion agrees with this: &#x2018;Era of Wonders is still under development, so for us the most important thing is to see how people respond to our game. Does everything work as we conceived it?&#x2019;<br><br>Most of the participants are combining SXSW Game Expo with other activities in the USA. Adriaan de Jongh undertook the longest tour: &#x2018;This trip began three weeks ago in Chicago. The creators of the game Cards Against Humanity have created a wonderful hub there, similar to the Dutch Game Garden in Utrecht but then more open. I then took part in the Train-Jam with Rami Ismail: a 52-hour train journey across America during which 50 developers collaborate on a game. We then travelled to San Francisco for the Game Developers Conference, which was a big success. Our mobile dance game Bounden won the Indie Mobile Game Award for innovation &#x2013; and now we&#x2019;re off to Austin.&#x2019; The Game Expo set-up is different to most other fairs, which requires a gearshift for the participants. This also results in different kinds of encounters. &#x2018;A police officer approached me and thanked me for Bounden, telling me that he often played it at home with his wife,&#x2019; says De Jongh. &#x2018;It&#x2019;s really special to find out that the game is actually being played here as well.&#x2019; <br><br>Joris Dormans (Ludomotion) and Karel Millenaar (Fourcelabs) are hosting a workshop with the title <a href=\"http://stimuleringsfonds.nl/en/latest/grants_issued/ludomotion_workshop_interactive_narratives_in_open_game_worlds/\">Interactive Narratives in Open Game Worlds</a> next Tuesday as part of the SXSW Interactive programme.

Involving the public in the search for new antibiotics is a fine example of this.&#x2019; <br><br>Today we will be cooking during the Trade Show, and the menu includes bonbons of mouse liver parfait. &#x2018;With the bonbons we are making here we want people to think about the cultural norms that get in the way of actual innovation in the field of food technology,&#x2019; Chlo&#xE9; Rutzerveld explains. &#x2018;Take the developments in the field of lab-grown meat: Scientists are trying to develop meat using bovine cells. Mouse cells would be much more appropriate, scientifically speaking, but that sparks so much opposition that nobody dares to do it. By asking people to step across their culturally determined boundaries we want them to think about radical but real scenarios for feeding the world in the future.&#x2019; <br><br>The visitors look at the Petri dishes with some trepidation; they are hardly American portions.

		"descriptionHtml": "<strong>For a number of years IDFA DocLab has been involved in the programming of SXSW&#x2019;s Digital Domain. The purpose of this collaboration is to build a bridge between the Amsterdam-based documentary film festival and the Interactive programme of this Texan technology festival. Today&#x2019;s two DocLab sessions addressed the work of Caspar Sonnen, Robert Overweg, Brian Chirls, Amy Rose and Jan Rothuizen.</strong><br><br>The first session offered visitors an introduction to the world of Virtual Reality (VR) and the application of related developments such as 360-degree video and interactive video. It seemed that this topic was fairly unfamiliar to the audience. This gave IDFA the opportunity to present an attractive overview of recent projects that are progressive in terms of technology as well as their artistry. <br><br>Robert Overweg&#x2019;s presentation placed his VR projects in a broader context. He caught the audience&#x2019;s attention by posing intriguing questions and theses about the future of VR. According to Robert Overweg, is should be no surprise that a new generation of VR natives will emerge in the foreseeable future, and they will value the virtual representation of the world as much &#x2013; or even more &#x2013; than the &#x2018;real&#x2019; world. The distinction between these two worlds is rapidly becoming blurred. Overweg also presented his own project, &#x2018;Beyond Sports&#x2019;: while watching a live football match you can switch to a virtual representation of the game in which you can choose your own perspective. A viewer can then experience the match through the eyes of the footballer. Overweg&#x2019;s presentation can be viewed at <a href=\"http://www.digital.robertoverweg.com\" target=\"_blank\">digital.robertoverweg.com</a>.<br><br>American developer Brian Chirls argued that the VR world is dominated by Silicon Valley and Hollywood, which he finds limiting and even dangerous. It might be possible to use a Google Cardboard costing about &#x20AC;3 to turn your smartphone into virtual-reality glasses, but Chirls wants to go further towards making VR technology accessible. After all, to make a VR product you need software and hardware that are not available to many people. He has set himself the goal of enabling people who have $50 to buy a cheap Android telephone and have access to the internet at a public location like a library to make VR products for themselves. He has therefore written an open-source script that can be run from the internet, and in a few simple steps you can make a VR product that you can open on your telephone as a 360-degree or Google Cardboard product. During his presentation he created a simple project that could be viewed and shared by the audience, thus demonstrating how simple and effective his script actually is. Click <a href=\"http://jsbin.com/?html,output\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> for the script.<br><br>Going by the reactions from the hall, many people were convinced by the potential of VR. Many visitors stayed for the more practical second session (showcase), during which Jan Rothuizen made real-time drawings for a VR environment.<br><br>During SXSW, IDFA DocLab organized various sessions in the context of the Digital Domain Program for the seventh time. <a href=\"http://stimuleringsfonds.nl/en/latest/grants_issued/idfa_doclab_showcase_at_sxsw_2015/\">IDFA DocLab</a> is one of the 16 projects that is being supported in the context of the <a href=\"http://stimuleringsfonds.nl/en/latest/news/open_call_for_participation_in_south_by_southwest_2015/\">Open Call: Participation in South by Southwest 2015</a>.",

		"descriptionHtml": "<strong>Today was another SXSW day with a full Dutch programme. In the new Digital Domain section of this technology festival in Texas it is evident that the Netherlands is a trendsetter in the realm of new forms of storytelling. This was exemplified by several substantive and well-visited panel sessions and presentations by Daniel Disselkoen of Headmade, a panel with Klasien van de Zandschulp, and a presentation of Behind the Blue Screen project by Jaap van Heusden and Ruben Pater. Tijmen Schep and Krista Hendriks of Setup presented their Cuddly Drones project as well.</strong><br><br>There&#x2019;s a huge queue for Salon 3 at the JW Marriott in downtown Austin: the title  <a href=\"http://stimuleringsfonds.nl/en/latest/grants_issued/headmade_unspecialize_the_more_you_know_the_less_you_see/\">Unspecialize: the more you know the less you see</a> has sparked the interest of a wide-ranging public. But what is Daniel Disselkoen&#x2019;s presentation actually about? In his comical manner, Disselkoen transports the audience in his fascination with the phenomenon of people looking less carefully at surroundings that are familiar to them. His work as a designer endeavours to change this. His latest tool for this is the mobile game <a href=\"https://cuca.lu/\" target=\"_blank\">Cucalu</a>, in which users are challenged to find and photograph specific shapes in their surroundings. Disselkoen explains that this has resulted in the world&#x2019;s largest collection of photos of round objects, but it has also brought many extraordinary and highly personal stories to light. <br><br><strong>Non-linear, location-specific narratives</strong><br>In the afternoon, the Austin Suite at the gigantic Austin Convention Center was the stage for a mixed panel with developers from Austin and the Dutch interaction designer <a href=\"http://stimuleringsfonds.nl/en/latest/grants_issued/klasien_van_de_zandschulp_tales_for_the_internet_of_things_catch_up_with_your_friends_from_the_golden_age_/\">Klasien van de Zandschulp</a>. They shared their experiences with the telling of non-linear location-specific stories via smartphones. The audience showed plenty of interest in the examples presented by Van de Zandschulp, including the <a href=\"[http://www.lavalab.nl/interactive-portrait-gallery-of-the-golden-age/\" target=\"_blank\">interactive portrait gallery</a> for the Amsterdam Museum.<br><br><strong>An app that shares personal stories safely</strong><br>Jaap van Heusden and Ruben Pater talked about their <a href=\"http://stimuleringsfonds.nl/en/latest/grants_issued/unlisted_roots_behind_the_blue_screen/\">Behind The Blue Screen</a> project, which collects everyday stories from Iran and distributes them via De Correspondent website. This video-app obscures the face of anyone who wants to remain anonymous, so it is possible to tell personal stories in a secure manner. In the hall there is a good mix of journalists, developers and visitors with a particular interest in Iran. The developers talked frankly about the many obstacles they have encountered during the project&#x2019;s realization, but also presented several striking examples to show how intriguing and poetic the results can be. They invited the session&#x2019;s audience to continue the session outside the hall in order to gather input for the project&#x2019;s ongoing development. This demonstrates the power of SXSW: it brings people together more quickly and they truly come to learn from each other.<br><br><strong>Cuddly Drones project about surveillance culture</strong><br>At the end of the afternoon it is the turn of Tijmen Schep and Krista Hendriks of Setup medialab to talk about the <a href=\"http://stimuleringsfonds.nl/en/latest/grants_issued/_stichting_setup_knuffeldrones/\">Cuddly Drones</a> project, which has been challenging children in the Netherlands to enter into an accessible interaction with drones in order for them to explore and embrace this phenomenon at an early age. Cuddly Drones was spawned by a series of Setup educational projects that critically question and investigate surveillance culture, which is strongly in the ascendant. To illustrate the story to better effect, the presenters actually brought a number of drones to Austin, which prompted some interesting discussions at border control. <br><br>From a bird&#x2019;s-eye, or rather a drone&#x2019;s-eye view, we can conclude that the Dutch speakers managed to captivate the public in Austin with narrative projects in which the poetic and artistic go hand in hand.<br><br>These project are supported via the <a href=\"http://stimuleringsfonds.nl/en/latest/news/open_call_for_participation_in_south_by_southwest_2015/\">Open Call for Participation in South by Southwest 2015</a>.",

This took place during the opening of the Eat Shit exhibition by Design Academy Eindhoven. You can read her speech here:<br><br><em>Good morning Ladies and Gentlemen,</em><br><br>I would like to wish you a very warm welcome on behalf of the Dutch Creative Industries Fund. For us &#x2013; as I hope it is for you &#x2013; this is a day of celebration. Because we are able to state that Dutch Design continues to rediscover and reinvent itself, and continues to live up to its strong international reputation.<br><br>The requests for presentations of Dutch Design reach us from cities and organizations all around the globe. Over the last year, the Fund has supported presentations in Seoul, Beijing, Tokyo, Cape Town and elsewhere. Sometimes these are solo or collective presentations in museums, but Dutch Design is starting to make its presence felt at festivals as well. Just like professional trade fairs, these can include a mixture of commercial and cultural activities, and they also manage to attract a wide-ranging public.<br><br>The number of cities around the world that are organizing Design Festivals seems to be growing rather than shrinking. It is therefore increasingly important for designers to choose their platforms carefully. For Dutch designers Milan continues to hold a special place. For them, Milan is still the place to be seen. It is the city where they establish connections for the further internationalization of their professional activities.<br>Over the week we will be encountering work by Dutch designers and manufacturers at a whole variety of venues across the city. At the fair itself, for sure, but also at the Satellite event, in the city centre, and at Ventura Lambrate in particular.<br><br><strong>30 supported designers and design collectives</strong><br>This year a total of 30 designers, or design collectives, are receiving support from the Fund for their presentations in Milan. Primarily these are highly talented start-ups, who with a small financial contribution are also being given the opportunity to strike out on the world stage &#x2013; and compare themselves with what is currently setting the trend internationally.<br>The interest in receiving the Fund&#x2019;s support was considerable. We received almost 80 reactions to the Open Call for presentations in Milan, which we issued late last year. A highly expert panel advised us with regard to the selection. This was no easy task, because of the astounding quality of the submissions. In this regard I would like to thank Suzanne Oxenaar, Ineke Hans and Annemartine van Kesteren for their expert input.<br><br>Looking back at all the submissions, the panel noted that Dutch Design is no longer limited to the design of &#x2018;things&#x2019;. Designers are expanding their expertise and sphere of activity in every direction imaginable. The advisory panel noted that young designers in particular are entering into collaborations with scientists. This allows them to develop new practices and leads to cross-overs with the healthcare sector, or with food production and food consumption.<br> <br>The result of these new practices is not necessarily a product; it could also be a process, service or pamphlet. Or it might be aimed at the creation of a new awareness, in relation to the ecological consequences of certain production techniques, for example. <br><br>Many designers are conducting research into the application of the latest technologies or are experimenting with the development of new materials. In response to the increasingly digital world, there is a growing interest in the feel of materials and the perception of space. What could design represent for this era? Some designers are taking their explorations of this question further and are operating within the rapidly expanding realm of social design. One aspect of this inquisitive, research-driven and sometimes activist approach is working within flexible and diverse networks and collectives, which the advisory panel highlighted as a specific characteristic of contemporary Dutch Design.<br>The images you have just seen pass by, were from the booklet we compiled to serve as a guide for a voyage of discovery through &#x2013; and into &#x2013; the presentations by designers who are being supported by the Creative Industries Fund. You will be surprised and delighted at many different venues. A visit to Milan is, after all, a wonderful opportunity to celebrate design and immerse yourself in all its diversity. I am confident that you will enjoy the adventure. I would like to thank the Dutch Ministry of Education, Culture and Science as well as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who make it possible for us to support these designers. We are also deeply grateful to the embassy, the consulate-general and  the New Institute  for their assistance during the preparations for this Design Week. And last but not least, we would like to express our thanks to the Design Academy for their warm hospitality and unfailing assistance and cooperation.<br><br><em>Images by Angeline Swinkels</em>",

		"descriptionHtml": "The design duo Pinar &amp; Viola is applying for a grant to develop prints and a textile collection based on the theme &#x2018;healing&#x2019;. It will draw inspiration from mystical, new-age and spiritual ideas and images to create ten prints. The duo will explore terms such as transience and flamboyance since these are represented everywhere, both in the fashion world and in our ubiquitous consumer society. The aim of the design label is to carry out visual activism in an ecological and spiritual manner to promote a just and humane future. This image collection entitled &#x2018;Paris Oasis &#x2013; Healing Prints&#x2019; therefore propagates a balanced and just future. In addition the designers are seeking for a new ethical aesthetic. In developing the prints the duo is combining digital craft with new technologies, for which it is harnessing democratic ways of digital production, such as digital textile print, soft digital fabrication and 3D printing. The prints, together with the textile collection, are to be presented during the Paris Fashion Week in a gallery appointed as an exclusive textile salon where peace, calm and quiet reign. The exhibition is accompanied by other events highlighting the relevant themes such as a pyjama party, meditation night, cleansing breakfast and tea ceremony.",

Entitled &#x2018;Almoist&#x2019;, this project is a follow-up to his graduation project &#x2018;Lark&#x2019;, which saw Mettler develop a scent in order to experiment with the textual and visual discourse this created. Now, in collaboration with perfume developers Drom International Fragrance, he is creating a scent of the city of Amsterdam, specifically that of Amsterdam&#x2019;s canal water. The designer views scent as an innovative and valuable medium for communicating sensual experiences and memories. He also maintains that olfactory design is dominated by branding and the attendant stereotyping and commercialization. As part of the project Niklaus Mettler intends to apply new forms of art-direction, thus offering an alternative to the existing perfume market. To this end he plans to collaborate with other disciplines and harness various media such as perfume packaging, installation, performance, music and online campaign. He will join forces with graphic designer Leonie Eichin, web designer Lexi Visco, music duo FAACILE2000, installation designers from NOMAN studio and members of performance group Contemporary Cruising.",

The design duo wonders to what extent this technique is an artform, a craft or a hobby. It is also seeking to explore the boundaries of the concept. The designers anticipate that, within the context of the graphic design biennial, this will provoke an interesting discussion. The exhibition will combine existing objects collected by the designers with new works. The show will also be underpinned by new audiovisual material. As preliminary research the designers plan to visit the Smithsonian Museum and a private collection with many painting-by-numbers works. They will also make contact with one of the founders of the technique. The Moravian Gallery in Brno is a partner in the project.",

She maintains that jewellery designs are often presented as autonomous objects with the result that this discipline is rarely placed within a contemporary social, cultural and economic context. By contrast Irma F&#xF6;ld&#xE9;nyi will explore jewellery design from a variety of disciplines, while at the same time investigating how specific characteristics of jewellery (design) can be applied to other fields. A preconceived theoretical framework is to be tested by drawing on both a theoretical research and a design experiment. This will see cross-overs to six other disciplines, including architecture, economy, film, history, literature and science. The project is to culminate in an online platform where research results, interviews and design experiments will be shared. In the meantime she will also work on a plan for a follow-up project.",

De Digitale Stad (DDS) is the oldest Dutch virtual community and until it closed down in 2001 it played an important part in the development of the internet in the Netherlands. However, the data from DDS was not stored securely and the data that is available is unsuitable for inclusion in an archive. Within the project the partners are developing new web-archeological methods to facilitate a reconstruction of DDS with a working interface. This will be complemented by a publication that offers museums and smaller heritage organizations with advice for the management of born-digital heritage and a manifesto about sustainable programming aimed at the work of present-day programmers.",

		"descriptionHtml": "Gabriel A Maher is a recent graduate of the Social Design Masters program at the Design Academy Eindhoven. With a background in interior architecture and design education, the practice is essentially focused on relationships between body and structure and an interest in objects and systems. An emerging methodology seeks to create situations where research and design come together in performance. Questioning design practices through queer and feminist frameworks has become a core position and approach. This methodology proposes an alternative position for the act and practice of design; To De___SIGN, which has become a working method and an action. As designers, we are essentially makers of meaning, we help to establish SIGNifications. To De___SIGN is to search for and pull apart complex systems of signs and meanings imbedded in any manner of things; Humans, objects, clothing, space. This process is a deconstruction. The De____sign(er) acknowledges that we must see beyond design as object and understand it fully within a system of representation. This system is the media, of which design is inseparable. This system becomes the framework of a social design practice. <br><br>The focus of this framework begins specifically with a critical link between gender identity + design and opens to broader critical themes from this starting point. The design industry is a major producer of cultural capital, and exerts a huge influence on the way we construct, perceive and materialise our identities. Gender identity in design is a subject, which remains limited and conservative within design thinking, practice and theory. While, culturally, approaches to gender identity are radicalised and diversified. This is a very important cultural shift. Therefore, it is urgent that the passive approach to this subject matter by the design industry must shift.<br><br>The position of this methodology is to make research active, tangible and accessible on many levels; public, institutional and practice based contexts. Research is not only written, it is visualised, it is performed, it is made physical, participatory and collaborative. Focusing primarily on techniques of visual and cultural analysis, Gabriel will collaboratively explore the relationship between the body + identity within systems of information. The components to develop within this methodology are: 01. Technologies for Seductive Criticism, 02. Strategies for Academic Entertainment and 03. Critical Tools for dialogue.",

They let her work autonomous, with their archive, and new seasonal themes. <br>She could develop both concept, as colorcards and graphical lay-outs by herself. Her signature can be described as bold and graphic, energetic and colourful. She works with hand-designed textiles and she starts each collection with a research on materials and dessins. She obtains inspiration from art, music, her friends and impressions she gets from the news and movies. Her collections are built up as a painting, each look exists of different layers carefully built op as a collage where the transparency of fabrics create an eclectic play-a-long between background and foreground. <br>This year, she will increasingly use materials she finds in her surroundings, including waste of textile factories, to emphasize an inevitable approach everyone working in the design-industry will need to have sooner or later to consider our environment in a better way.",

She received an MA degree in Cultural Studies from the Radboud Universiteit Nijmegen in 2007, and a BDes degree in Textile Design from the Rietveld Academie Amsterdam in 2013. She explores the dynamics between theory and practice of design, and her main fields of interest are the relation between ethics and aesthetics in design, DoItYourself practices, modernism and antimodernism, and gender politics. In 2014 she was nominated for the Simon Mari Pruys Prize for design criticism for Dirty Design (<a href=\"http://dirtydesign.net/\">dirtydesign.net</a>), her sustainable design manifesto.<br>In 2015 she was artistinresidence at Villa Waldberta in Munich, where she started working on Dirty Clothes , a collection of unisex clothing made of used clothes. The intent of this collection is to research how the aesthetics of repurposed textiles can be exploited in contemporary, everyday pieces of clothing. Every item is unique and made out of a selection of leftover and secondhand materials, which necessarily involves costly handwork. To avoid these designs only being available for the wealthy few, Van Helvert will create a magazine consisting of all the patterns and instructions for making the clothes at home. The magazine<br>will be an experiment in combining fashion photography, patterns, and instructions, with essays on the fashion industry, the role of DIY production in past and present contexts, and the influence of gender norms in fashion.<br>Next to working on the Dirty Clothes collection and magazine, Van Helvert is currently editing and writing a book on ideas on sustainability and social change in the history of design, under the working title The Responsible Object: A History of Design Ideology for the Future . This volume will include chapters on iconic designers and schools such as William Morris, Bauhaus and Victor Papanek among lesser known examples, who explicitly worked on design for a better world. Specialized authors will critically analyse these designers&#x2019;<br>contributions to the discourse on social and sustainable design, in an effort to reevaluate how this important part of design history can help us with urgent questions of change today.<br>Both of these projects are a quest for the role of the idealistic designer today. What does it mean to be a designer in a world with too much stuff? Does good, responsible design exist? Can designers make a change in the world?",

His work is focused on the way people experience and feel the world by means of interactions with a variety of sensory stimuli. He is interested in rediscovering our senses and for this she intends to develop devices for practical use. His development plan consists of five phases including contextual research, sensory experiment and tool development.<br>Wu: &quot;We experience the environment through our sensory organs. They generate electrical impulses according to certain stimuli they can perceive. These electrical impulses are transmitted to the brain, and then the brain interprets them into sensations. In other words, our senses is the interpretation of our brain about the electrical impulses it receives. The existence of the stimuli in the environment are more close to a type of electrical signals to our brain. Therefore, our perception of the world can be regarded as a bunch of datapoints, what our sensory organs do is to perceive the stimuli and encode them into electrical data that our brain can understand.<br>I assume it is possible to convert the signals generated by different sensory organs into the same formations, which means sensation can be digitalised and translated. My aim of this project is to discover the formulas of translating sensations through series of experiments and provide other perspectives of how human can perceive the world.&quot;",

LAfA provides a map for navigating the paradoxes of intellectual property today. For artists and designers copyright is a double edged sword: while makers can enjoy its protection when exploiting their own works, the creation of these works becomes difficult, as the ability to build upon the work of others has been restraint. LAfA looks at the basic parameters of copyrights: who gets it? for what work? how? and for how long? It investigates the underlying concepts of authorship and original creation. Then: how do the categories of copyright apply to different media, and what happens when a work moves from medium to medium? And how does copyright relate to the web of related legal concepts: moral rights, image rights, trademarks, patents?<br><br>LAfA wants to allow artists not just to understand copyright, but also re-claim a role in debate on the legal conditions of their profession. After all, law makers and the media industry invoke the figure of the artist to justify increased copyrights. Even cultural institutions can turn themselves against both artists and the public, by making false copyright claims on the works in their collections. LAfA hopes to be a valuable tool for of artists educating themselves in intellectual property law, who formulate their own responses to the urgent questions copyright creates today. LAfA is a legal experiment in its own right: it is illustrated with images whose right to publish is contested.",

In so doing she generates techniques and creates mechanical sculptures that are manifested on a variety of poetical levels. Her development plan states that she wants to further develop the installation Red Horizon:  a field of double pendulums where in time collective expressions are generated. She is seeking to take this further during a residency at Werktank in Leuven. She is also collaborating on the project Jumping Power Plant in which movement is transformed into light. In addition she intends to extend the scope of her knowledge of cybernetics and complex systems.",

The designers and artists who are participating in this group presentation explain that they are preoccupied with grand gestures, rituals and themes drawn from an aesthetic world of material, colour and form. Central to the presentation is a number of coffins, which are made from canvas and are suitable for recycling. The coffins are available in children&#x2019;s sizes as well as in larger sizes for adults. There was an earlier presentation of this concept during the Dutch Design Week, which led to Jan van der Ploeg being asked to participate in this group exhibition at the Salone, which is being staged at Ventura Lambrate. <br><br>photo: Kevin Rijnders",

The biennale opened on 4 December, which also marked the start of a Dutch Week that involved a whole range of activities. Rezone presented a mobile, inflatable and interactive pavilion, which amasses data about the city. The pavilion is a synthesis of light, sound, space and movement, which combine to form a three-dimensional &#x2018;screen&#x2019; that visualizes and represents certain (social) data. This platform reacts to data that it gathers from the internet as well as data that is sent directly by the public via social media. This data is translated into a synthesis of various art forms which capture a particular city emotion. Rezone also organized a hackathon, which took place on 5 and 6 December, in conjunction with the biennale. During the hackathon they went in search of special sounds, data and colours that are specific to the city. They programme this information into an interactive spatial experience that is meant to capture the sense of the city.",

The project aim is to develop an integral spatial development strategy for Nakawa Market Area, one of Kampala&apos;s big markets. The team consists of BSpace, CRS (MVO Nederland), Oubuntu design agency, Remco Rolvink Spatial Strategies, Martyrs University Institute of Architects and sustainable business firm Originate. With 40,000 daily visitors, it&apos;s one of Kampala&apos;s main sources of (fresh) food. It also provides daily income for 230,000 people who live in informal settlements near the market. The surrounding area has been rezoned for a satellite city. Kampala&apos;s rapid development puts immense pressure on this area. This results in a lack of good quality housing, clean water, sanitation, reliable power supply, waste management and mobility. BSpace recognizes that dealing with these issues means relating and involving the local systems of economy, ecology, society and spatial development and the related stakeholders.Understanding and improving the flows in cities (urban metabolism) is a key challenge in urbanism. In Nakawa area, these flows are out in the open. Analyzing and mapping the integrality of these systems and their business is expected to give valuable insights that can be applied in other cities facing similar development challenges. The team analyzes and maps all relevant systems, flows of value and stakeholders to develop integral spatial scenarios for the area. These scenarios will be used to develop new value propositions for current stakeholders and innovative entrepreneurs who may contribute to the area&apos;s redevelopment. Specific attention will be given to re-construction of the market itself, management of the area and the proposed satellite city to be built next to the market.",

DWM is an international design platform that aims to stimulate creativity and design as values which contribute to Mexico&#x2019;s social, economic and aims to cultural development. The five-day event at which they will give the workshop attracts about 26,000 visitors. Andrews and Degen used a design methodology to guide the participants in giving a visual reaction to local findings, problems, ideas and visions in order to be able to present solutions and interventions in the public space. They thus intended to investigate how designers can contribute to urban life in Mexico City and unlock this knowledge with a small publication and a public presentation. The design studio has previously given this workshop in cities such as Dakar, Chongqing and Zagreb.",

A wide variety of international designers, galleries and studios showcase their products during MADE, which ran from 11 to 16 August. The fair also organizes an in-depth programme to boost education and interchange. Its organizers strive to present new talent, encourage new products and increase public interest in design. &#x2018;Dreaming&#x2019; is an installation that incorporates lace leftovers from the Amsterdam Museum and Museum Willet-Holthuysen. The installation was presented in the MADE exhibition that features work which is not for sale. Van Gemert also had the opportunity to sell a selection of her work at the fair and was asked to give a presentation during the MADE conference. The designer hoped that participating in this event would raise her profile in Brazil and help her to network with galleries, museums and collectors in the run-up to a solo exhibition of her work at a museum in Brazil in 2016.",

This work is mostly based on a reinterpretation of traditions and customs from other cultures. For the Blueprint project the designer is investigating the interaction between original and copy. The reason for this is Valkeman&#x2019;s fascination with the cycle of creation and imitation which has occurred in the Chinese and Dutch porcelain industries since the 17th century. Initially Chinese porcelain was imitated in the Netherlands, later on Dutch porcelain was reproduced in China, and then production moved back to the Netherlands again. The designer wants to translate this interaction into several textile designs, with traditional porcelain decoration serving as inspiration for the patterns on table textiles. To do this she will be conducting a social experiment during the Dutch Days in Chongqing. During this event, a wide-ranging public from diverse cultural backgrounds will provide input by sitting down at a table where people can share food, stories and creativity. Visitors will depict their stories, symbols or messages on white table linen and ceramic objects. Valkeman will transform these depictions into dynamic patterns that represent the dialogue between various cultures. For her artistic development she will be visiting two ceramics centres in China and attending a residency programme at the Sanbao Ceramic Art Institute. Valkeman will be presenting the results at the Saatchi Gallery in Chongqing and the Sanbao Gallery in Jingdezhen.",

During this study, Cityfoerster and Albanian government parties focused on issues relating to spatial planning and economy in Albania. The study consisted of a series of brainstorming sessions led by Meine van der Graaf of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), which focused on developing an interdisciplinary pilot project on Agro-Tourism in Albania. The pilot project should in particular make clear what the added value of integrated planning and the involvement of stakeholders at an early stage of the design process is. In the next phase, the various parties together with local entrepreneurs work at the cases that have emerged from the pilot. The Dutch Embassy, &#x200B;&#x200B;some local government departments and the National Enterprising Netherlands (RVO) support the initiative. With this project Cityfoerster aims to contribute in strengthening the Albanian position in the European and global economy.<br><br>Together with experts from marketing, tourism and agriculture, CITYF&#xD6;RSTER recently concluded a research into the potential links between these sectors and identified a number of business cases for local entrepreneurs and opportunities for international companies with a focus on sustainable products and services. The team had conducted an exploratory mission to understand and map out spatial potentials and urgencies along the Albanian Coast as a basis for a large scale development concept as well as small scale design measurements for certain business cases. The research was commissioned by the Dutch embassy in Tirana and has been presented to Albanian authorities and stakeholders in October. <br><br>A consortium of Dutch, Swiss, and Albanian companies and organizations work on spatial design, business cases for local entrepreneurs and opportunities for international companies with a focus on sustainable products and services. The online publication is available now.<br><br>Tourism is in many countries a driving force for the economy. However, it is often developed isolated from other economically relevant sectors and in many cases has a negative impact on communities, environment and other business.  For Albania this is currently the case. Coastal area&apos;s have been rapidly developed for tourism in recent years with only one goal: to make money fast. Lack of planning and enforcement of regulations have lead to wild and uncontrolled development of privately owned real estate that stands abandoned for 80% of the year. Consequently a protection of unique features, esthetics and holistic vision have not been a priority resulting in generic, unsightly buildings along large parts of the Albanian coastline.<br>On the other hand there is still a lot of undeveloped territory and the will to create a sustainable alternative to the devastating development of recent years. An alternative that will benefit local communities, businesses from other sectors such as construction, agro food and processing.<br>For Dutch private sectors Albania offers a lot of opportunities. It is close by and relatively undeveloped. For tourism it is a country that has the potential to become a preferred destination for adventurous travelers in the near future. For the food sector it offers unique products such as wild medicinal herbs and teas.<br>In the project The Traveler and the Olive Grove Cityf&#xF6;rster Architecture &amp; Urbanism works together with MVO Nederland, and Dutch and local partners from tourism, agriculture, spatial design and landscape architecture on a development model for a seaside area in Albania named Qeparo.

They do this during their six-week residency in which knowledge production and product development are central and they will be working closely with various parties in Eindhoven. The organisation also focusses on setting up follow-up processes in which the knowledge gained is implemented in the local communities in the home country. This is done in collaboration with the local Hivos offices. The results will be presented at the Dutch Design Week 2015.",

		"descriptionHtml": "RAAAF has been invited to show their installation &#x201C;The End of Sitting&#x201D; during the first Architecture Biennale in Chicago. The Biennale takes place from October 2015 through January 2016. After Chicago, the installation will travel to Los Angeles and New York and possibly other cities as well. The RAAAF project has been selected by curators Sarah Herda (Graham Foundation) and Joseph Grima (former editor DOMUS). They selected the project because they believe that it fits into the theme about radical and ground-breaking concepts for the everyday living environment. &#x201C;The End of Sitting&#x201D; is an alternative to the ubiquitous office environment where the working population spends most of their time in a seated position. To show the installation in America, RAAAF will create a version that can be transported in a standard shipping container. This makes long-distance transportation easier. In the run-up to and during the Biennale, RAAAF will approach and invite the press in a personal way to come and experience the installation. This strategy has generated a lot of attention for the project in the Netherlands and in Europe. In addition, the applicant aims to target innovative companies such as Google, Groupon, research groups from Harvard and UC Berkeley.",

The New Raw Plastic (TNR-P) is the first case study in which the 3D technique is used as a sustainable method for regional production. For this, plastic waste is used. The project takes place within the closed ecosystem of the Greek island of Syros and focusses in particular on plastic waste generated by tourism, horticulture and agriculture. The project aims to address global issues through local examples. For the TNR-P project, cooperation has been sought with local authorities, the University and other parties so as to be able to monitor the various plastic waste flows on the island. Together, the results produced are the &#x2018;statement-pieces&#x2019; which will be communicated worldwide through publications and exhibitions.<br>The Advisory Committee is positive about the concept of The New Raw Plastic in which plastic waste flows are linked to 3D production techniques. It finds the research into an alternative form of recycling and the attention to local awareness relevant. It is interested to know whether the closed ecosystem of Syros can serve as a worldwide model.",

This also impacts on energy consumption or gas emissions, for example. And over time the quality of city life can be undermined. In the IABR&#x2019;s opinion, design and design-based research can make a valuable contribution to solving urban issues. The theme of the 2015-2016 programme is &#x2018;The Next Economy&#x2019; and it focuses on the relationship between spatial design and the economy or, in other words, it is an investigation into the relationship between space and production. This links the city with four socioeconomic research issues: the city as platform for production, as platform for producer, as metabolism and the demand for new urban-development models. These issues will be reflected in the project ateliers or work places for design-based research. During the biennale these locations and results are reflected in the exhibitions.

Full exploitation of the visual possibilities of the paper is a prerequisite when designing Das Magazin. In 2014 the collaboration between Das Magazin and Studio Vruchtvlees was crowned with a European Design Award. In the summer of 2015 the magazine wants to present itself internationally by producing an English-language edition and organizing a literary festival in London. Dutch writers and designers are keen to present themselves on an international platform and there have been questions from abroad asking whether Das Magazin will be taking the step towards becoming an international platform. Half of the inaugural English-language edition will consist of Dutch texts in translation; the other half will comprise contributions from English-language authors. The festival involves ten or so reading clubs at various locations in London, where 25 readers, a discussion leader and an author will gather. to discuss a Dutch- or English-language literary work will be discussed at each reading club. The applicant states that the magazine has become a platform where creative talents come together at the cutting edge of literature and design. In London there is cooperation with the magazine Delayed Gratification, magazine curator Stack, the Dutch Centre and the Dutch Embassy.",

In the summer of 2015, local participants and up-and-coming designers will spend 10 days cooperating with leading experts from the Dutch design community, such as Frans Oosterhof, Lotte van Gelder, Matthias Kreutze &amp; Jens Schildt (Our Polite Society Studio) and Elisa van Joolen.

A diversity of questions and themes will be investigated by means of workshops, exhibitions, exploratory studies and lectures. How is our behaviour moulded by our local surroundings? What are the best ways to collaborate and engineer an effect on society? Can we define a new role for designers of today and the future? The eventual outcomes of the workshops will be shared in the form of public presentations. One of the project&#x2019;s key objectives is the creation of an international network for collaborations between designers and other professionals from the Netherlands and Bulgaria, who will focus their efforts on social and urban issues.",

In connection with this, the applicants perceive a demand for a visual representation and elaboration of an integral development strategy for sustainable food production in Kazachstan.

The applicants want to illustrate the spatial implications of an integral approach and thereby contribute to a transition within agriculture and the landscape. For this aspect, the above-mentioned parties will be collaborating with Witteveen+Bos engineering firm, Wageningen UR university and research centre, and BOM Group glass horticulture consultants.

Subjects that will be addressed during this lecture include the future of explorers, how you can use technology to investigate reality, and whether we are still capable of altering what we see.<br><br>Location: JW Marriott Salon 3<br>16 march 2015, 11.00-12.00 hrs",

The aim of this initiative is to test out the applicability of Dutch expertise in the field of urban development in the context of Chinese metropolitan regions. Chinese-Dutch design projects, research, week-long workshops, seminars and exchanges are also being organized within the framework of this programme.<br><br><strong>The 2013 reconnaissance</strong><br>The first exploratory work week was held in September 2013 during the Beijing Design Week. Dutch and Chinese participants tackled three pilot projects in Beijing that were proposed by a local stakeholder, the Fengtai District Planning Bureau. You can read more about this undertaking <a href=\"http://stimuleringsfonds.nl/en/latest/news/364/daily_report_from_the_beijing_design_week_29_september_2013\">here</a>.<br><br>Since then the interest in Towards2050 has grown, among Dutch as well as Chinese organizations, knowledge institutions and businesses. This shows there is a growing realization that today&#x2019;s complex urban issues call for a multidisciplinary approach and international cooperation. <br><br><strong>Transit-Oriented Development</strong><br>This year&#x2019;s theme is Transit-Oriented Development (TOD).

They are working together with professors and students on projects that contribute to smart, competitive, sustainable and healthy urban regions.&#x2019; <br><br><strong>Cooperation</strong><br>One special aspect of the programme is the close cooperation between designers and financial specialists. This teamwork was inspired by the Chinese government&#x2019;s desire to improve the quality of life in cities by means of a market-oriented strategy rather than a planned economy approach.

In addition the designers are encouraged to collaborate with local parties to develop work that will also feature in the exhibition. The museum is joining forces with the Cultural Embassy Amsterdam and the Lloyd Hotel in Amsterdam for communications, promotion and pre-events. A portion of the show will be featured during the 2015 Dutch Design Week. With this exhibition the organization aims to access local businesses and large technology concerns, as well as design and art students.

In her development plan Dessing states that she wants to carry out further research into the conditions of the park location.  On the one hand by undertaking theoretical research into the sensitivities and possibilities of a situation that has friction.

In her work Langendijk explores the crafts and style characteristics of a specific area in order to incorporate these in her own collections. Her graduation collection focused on traditional Japanese fashion, spawning a collection where textiles with minimal tailoring were wrapped around the body and secured with clasps. In contrast to current fashion, this technique allowed Langendijk to construct one-size garments. In her development plan Langendijk lays great emphasis on the sustainable production of textiles and collections. She hopes at the end of the year to be in a position to advise high-fashion companies on this subject. She will carry out her research partly in the Netherlands and partly during a trip to Japan. While in Japan she will visit both small villages where the old crafts are still practised, and cities where modern applications are sought. She will also seek out exchanges with local fashion students. In addition an apprenticeship with Nike in the United States will enable Langendijk to gain a different perspective on sustainability. The results of the research coupled with a number of visits to international meetings are to serve as the springboard for a newly developed product, which Langendijk intends to present during the London Fashion Week.",

In the coming year Henri&#xEB;tte is compiling a book about the project Hunnie in which her methodology will de dissected and analysed. This will make the method more insightful and also applicable to other projects. In addition the designer will embark on a long-term collaboration with the philosopher Clemens Driessen, a researcher in the field of ethics in the relationship between man, animals and nature, among others. This collaboration is intended to result in a number of concepts for water management that are to be showcased at the Biennial of Design Ljubljana.

This has prompted him to reconstruct the MONIAC, a 1950s machine. This machine simulated extremely accurately the economies of Great Britain and Peru, for instance, using a system of sluices and pumps to move water from various different tanks. Hendrik views this machine as an excellent antidote to the increasingly complex economic models. In addition Henrik is to make an installation that will reveal the developments relating to so-called Deep Packet Inspection.

In the Art &amp; Space Initiative Munnik wants to foster collaboration between artists and scientists who are interested in space, and for this he has joined forces with ESTEC in Noordwijk. The installation 3600 Orbits is a project with lasers in the landscape which gives the position, in real time, of some of the many satellites in space. The lasers are used to connect the earth to the satellites. Munnik will also investigate how to make local and temporary &#x2018;walls of light&#x2019; that appear with the aid of LED lights and water damp. In addition Munnik wants to expand his knowledge of electronics, astronomy and liquid dynamics. In the theoretical field he intends to acquire greater in-depth knowledge of cybernetics.",

		"descriptionHtml": "Nicky Assmann graduated in 2011 from the Interfaculty of the Royal Conservatoire and the Royal Academy of Art, The Hague, with a Masters in Art Science. In her work Assmann experiments with the properties, behaviour and aesthetics of materials such as liquid soap, liquid crystals and metals. Her work also reveals an interest in how the human senses perceive these materials and natural phenomena. This phenomenological approach is expressed in different media, such as wearable technology, audiovisual performances and kinetic installations. Sensory experience forms the central focus of these installations. She draws her inspiration from phenomena such as reflection, refraction of light, crystallization, oxidation, turbulence and iridescence. In the coming year Nicky seeks to extend her knowledge of materiality by means of literature research, attending symposia, lectures and masterclasses. She also intends to produce a written reflection on her own work and encourage feedback from other artists, makers and mentors, including Tina Frank and Maria Verstappen. In addition she is inviting a writer/theorist to write about her work. Alongside this theoretical aspect, Nicky wants to develop her practical knowledge by taking part in a conference in London, among other things. For her artistic development Nicky is focusing on the project Solstice that explores how the above-mentioned phenomena are manifested in large frozen soap bubbles. For this Assmann will go to Finland where cold temperatures essential to the freezing process are a regular feature. Finally Nicky is to carry out another research into oxidation processes and into moir&#xE9; patterns.",

The applicant already received a start-up grant to organize the Dutch submission and devise a programme. The project includes various studies, mapping activities and interventions in the public space in Prague, executed by a multidisciplinary group of Dutch scenographers, architects and thinkers. Participants are being selected by means of an open call. The point of departure for the activities is the organization&#x2019;s postulation that modern-day reality is no longer unequivocal, that different forms of reality co-exist but do not interact. The way designers hold their own in this multidimensional reality is laid bare using five strategies: fight, flight, hiding, mediation and immersion. In Prague these strategies and the realized activities will be shared with an international audience. The organization is aiming to unlock and make manifest the mindset and modus operandi of scenography, so that new links can be established between various disciplines. Platform Scenography ultimately wants to compile the outcomes into a scenographic manual that draws together scenographic tools, methods and strategies accompanied by critical reflections. <br><br><strong>Between Realities awarded Gold Medal for Best Curatorial Concept at PQ15</strong><br>Platform Scenography was recently awarded the Prague Quadrennial&#x2019;s Gold Medal for Curatorial Concept of an Exhibition. The honour was presented by the Czech Republic&#x2019;s Minister of Culture during the Awards Ceremony on Monday, 22 June 2015 at the Archa Theatre in Prague. The jury was impressed by the complexity of the concept: &#x2018;In essence, performance design is being used to understand the city, and this in turn challenges us to think again about what performance design is and what it can do. The documentation process will allow this project to have a continuing influence beyond the period of the PQ.&#x2019;<br><br>Between Realities is a project that involved designers and artists working in the public space of Prague, instead of exhibiting existing work. All participants aimed to make visitors to the PQ or unsuspecting passers-by experience the city in a different way or shift their perspective in a subtle or not so subtle way. The team of curators, consisting of Anne Karin ten Bosch (chair), Sanne Danz, Sigrid Merx, Iris Schutten and Ester van de Wiel, invited the following designers and artists to participate: Naomi Bueno de Mesquita, Carly Everaert, Katja Heitmann, Julian Hetzel, Vinny Jones, Rick van der Linden, Maarten van Otterdijk, Hieke Pars, Eva Schippers and Florian de Visser.<br><br>The focus in Between Realities is on the tension within urban space: on the one hand the increasing Disneyfication of the city centre and the degree to which it caters wholly to the needs, wishes and expectations of tourists, especially during the summer; on the other hand, the ordinary, plain, everyday life that also exists &#x2013; though it is not always visible.

		"descriptionHtml": "Initiated by Bureau Europa (Saskia van Stein) and Dutch Design Exchange (Marc Maurer and Nicole Maurer) and curated by Institute of Relevant Studies (Agata Jaworska and Giovanni Innella), Domestic Affairs (working title: Land of Plenty: Aesthetics, Ethics and Commerce) was presented at PASSAGEN 2015 in Cologne, Germany showcasing the work of over 50 Dutch designers.  <br><br>The exhibition was grouped in four chapters that dealt with issues such the urge for privacy and popularity, the urge to regain control over our means of sustenance, the simultaneous prestige and precarity of global nomadism and the need to adapt traditional notions of identity, family, love and industry. The exhibition was opened with a discussion on these aspects of our home, moderated by Justin McGuirk.  <br><br>Bureau Europa&apos;s intention with this project is to investigate how design, aesthetics, ethics and production are functioning in a post-internet and post-crisis era, and thus contribute to a discourse about the role of design in the contemporary living environment. This new discourse will also serve to generate new cultural narratives at places, such as a furniture fair, which are traditionally dominated by commerce. <br><br>Dutch Design Exchange (DDX) is an organisation devoted to set up projects in order to mediate the Dutch Creative Industry into a fully interdisciplinary and international operating sector without any boundaries.<br><br>The identity was created by Design Displacement Group, and the exhibition was supplemented by a newspaper featuring news articles, essays and advertisements all having impact on the domestic context.  <br><br>Het Nieuwe Instituut supported the initiative by inviting several of the participating designers and facilitating discussion with the public and members of the industry based in Germany.  <br><br>DOMESTIC AFFAIRS is a project by Bureau Europa (Saskia van Stein) and Dutch Design Exchange (Marc and Nicole Maurer), curated by the Institute of Relevant Studies (Agata Jaworska and Giovanni Innella).  <br><br>Featuring work by: * Atelier NL * Bas van Beek * Robin Bergman * Konrad Bialowas *Laura Cornet * Droog Lab * Earnest Studio * EventArchitectuur * Govert Flint * Maaike Fransen * Alix Gallet *  Corradino Garofalo * Ward Goes * Imme van der Haak * Gerard Jasperse * Elisa van Joolen * Chris Kabel * Anja Kaiser * Martti Kalliala * Merel Karhof * Noortje de Keijzer * Erik Kessels * Pieteke Korte * Karel Martens * Arnout Meijer * Mieke Meijer * Metahaven * Migle Nevieraite * Simone C.

The theme of identity is the interlinking element in Sanpatchayapong&#x2019;s jewellery. The form, material and technique used to produce the jewellery are not fixed but are determined by the intended end result. Sanpatchayapong works with fabrics and precious metals, among other things. In his development plan Sanpatchayapong writes that he wants to build on his work with necklaces, linked to identity. Following on from his last series of portrait broaches, the designer is to explore how someone&#x2019;s identity can be translated into a more abstract object. In addition Sanpatchayapong wants to investigate how necklaces can radiate a brand identity. A preliminary research has convinced the designer that many major brands do not explore this aspect in sufficient depth. Sanpatchayapong will present the results during solo shows in the Jewelers&#x2019; Werk Galerie in Washington and at the ATTA Gallery in Bangkok.",

Ricky has outlined three projects that are intended to enhance his artistic and conceptual development as a professional designer. SoundShapes is an exploration into Chladni resonance patterns. When the patterns are translated into a spatial form, which is then harnessed to produce sound, a special kind of speaker is created. Van Broekhoven wants to continue developing this design &#x2013; thus extending his understanding of the technical side of speaker production - and collaborate with producers. The second project, Hands Off, is a collaborative venture with designer Niek Pulles to make an installation for the Museum for Arts and Crafts in San Francisco. This installation collects and reacts to heartrate data of visitors. The development plan&#x2019;s third trajectory concentrates on documenting and sharing research. In addition the designer will focus on professionalizing his practice by increasing his knowledge of marketing and PR, and software.",

Timing, insight and a dose of good luck determine whether you are on the receiving end of the increasingly deadly projectile or are dealing out the blows yourself. Lethal League can be played one against one at competitive level or as a &#x2018;party game&#x2019; for 4 players.<br><div class=\"vidcon\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/swJJDf2jv88\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>",

		"descriptionHtml": "&#x2018;Mapping Slow Design: Topics, Tools and Traces&#x2019; is an exhibition curated by Carolyn Strauss and Ana Paula Pais in New York&#x2019;s Pratt Manhattan Gallery. The show spotlights the ethos of slowLab, a design-research organization founded by Carolyn Strauss that places the Slowdesign concept centre stage. Slowdesign encompasses models, theories, objects and ideas about alternative and conscious ways of living, and seeks to relate in a sustainable manner to today&#x2019;s transitory and driven society.  The exhibition tackles themes such as &#x2018;Slowidentity&#x2019;, &#x2018;Slowagency&#x2019; and Sloweconomy&#x2019;. The curators have selected a number of projects pointing up this theme, including work by Maria Blaisse and Henri&#xEB;tte Waal. The show also includes video-installations of interviews with actors from the Slowdesign movement such as Judith van den Boom. To extend its scope, the curators are also organizing several educational events and workshops in collaboration with local institutions, including City Science, Noguchi Museum, Usonia and DUMBO Arts Festival. The organization aims to reach a broad spectrum of the public, as well as design professionals, the media and students.",

Sonic Acts has borrowed the term &#x2018;dark ecology&#x2019; from the American philosopher Timothy Morton. According to the applicant, the term describes how we live in a hostile ecology where the central focus is the perspective of living and not-living things with man only forming a part. The project is to generate nine newly produced works, three expeditions, participatory events, publications and an online platform. The organization indicates that it will collaborate with an interdisciplinary group of designers and local partners. Sonic Acts has previously conducted exploratory reconnaissance research trips in the Barents region in 2012 and 2013.

Together with the local population of the northern Canadian Nunavut, Pater is working on a graphic novel about traditional local imagery that allows the population to pass on their own stories to young Inuit. Users can upload their own photographs, drawings and collages into the application, where, together with traditional images, they form an image bank. Collaboration with the local media company IsumaTV ensures access to ten settlements that are nearly impossible to reach. Applying a graphic filter on the input, Pater produces a graphic novel with a coherent style. Besides the comic, which will be distributed in the communities, the project will yield a mobile exhibition and an application that, with minimal adjustment, can also be used in other cultural contexts.<br><br><strong>Telling stories for preservation</strong><br>What does the outside world actually know about the everyday lives of the Inuit people in the Arctic? How do they spend their days, what survives of their traditions, what are their aspirations and dreams? Designer Ruben Pater is working with the local media company Isuma TV to develop a storytelling application with which young Inuit people can tell their own stories using their own footage and images. &#x2018;Telling stories is an important link in the preservation of a culture,&#x2019; says Pater. Workshops in various Inuit villages to teach children how to use the app will be held during the summer. <br><br>Pater wants to use the images for a graphic novel in which centuries-old traditions are contrasted against the everyday reality and dreams of the current generation of youngsters. The book is not solely intended for the Inuit people themselves, but also allows the outside world to be part of their world. &#x2018;In Time Machine, folk myths and knowledge are passed on in a new form. The project is currently focusing on the Inuit, but could also be deployed in another cultural context.&#x2019;",

		"descriptionHtml": "Breed facilitates cooperation between manufacturers and designers from the earliest phase of the design process, in which dialogue between the parties and reinforcing each other&#x2019;s knowledge and skill are pivotal. This results in an efficient product in a shorter time, because designers are not hampered by impracticalities during production and manufacturers can think outside the box of their usual approach. The resulting products are optimal, according to Breed, because material and technology as well as design acuity are exploited to the full. Breed intends to use this approach to realize innovative interior objects with a unique story. The five designers who are involved in this process are Studio Wieki Somers, De Makers Van, Chris Kabel, Christien Meindertsma and Marleen Kaptein. These designers are collaborating with six manufacturers: 3D Metalforming, Lovink, Sneeboer, NPSP Composites, Enkev and Kumagaya. The aim of Breed&#x2019;s group presentation during the Salone del Mobile is to showcase the label&#x2019;s vision. The participants will be showing various works that arose from these collaborations, thus providing an inspiring example for professionals, media and consumers. They also hope to shed light on the manufacturing sector&#x2019;s potential to contribute to innovative design. The Breed label also aims to encourage the manufacturing sector to enter into similar projects with designers.",

Anne Wenzel&#x2019;s experiments with foaming glaze add a new dimension to the function of glazing: this glaze erodes the underlying layer of clay and thus becomes a means of expression. Anton Reijnders uses ceramics for work that goes beyond the bounds of applied art. Tim Breukers, who is currently working at the Rijksacademie in Amsterdam, is also intent on exploring materials and techniques, thus emphasizing their plastic qualities. Floris Wubben devised and built an extrusion machine with which he presses large quantities of clay (up to 30 kilograms in one go) through profiles.",

The liquid can thus be made to move to the rhythm of the music, just like blood being pumped through arteries. Hard Core Vein is a combination of craftsmanship and advanced 3D printing techniques. A first prototype of the design exists, the 1.0 version. The start-up grant will be used, among other things, to conduct research into materials and to make 3D sketches. Based on the initial results, a new project plan for the actual production will be developed and a multidisciplinary production team formed.",

She noticed that people around her with incontinence are more inclined to become socially isolated due to insecurity and anxiety. Veldhuijzen van Zanten maintains that practical solutions, such as incontinence pads, fail to address the emotional impact experienced by people with urinary incontinence. Moreover incontinence pads are not sustainable, attractive or comfortable to wear. Protective Underwear consists of a specially designed incontinence material for women that is comfortable and washable. She collaborated with Artofil, a company specializing in absorbent yarn. The project&#x2019;s first presentation was sponsored by the Audax Textile Museum. In South Korea Veldhuijzen seeks to instigate discussion about potential daily aids for elderly people in a rapidly ageing society and discover how Koreans deal with this issue.",

		"descriptionHtml": "Zero Hour is Lisa Mandemaker&#x2019;s graduation collection that consists of a series of moving objects driven by clock mechanisms. Mandemaker wants to graphically illustrate the abstraction of both our sense of time and the passing of time, and make it experienceable. She started this project with research into the increasing over-diagnosis of children, focusing mainly on the symptoms of dyscalculia. Two works from the collection are being showcased at the Seoul Design Festival. &#x2018;Sequential Elapse in Blue Divided by Blue&#x2019; is a flip clock where the numbers have been replaced by colours which, for the onlooker, serve to provoke a different sense of time.  The wall installation &#x2018;Zero Hour&#x2019; is a spatial representation of the passing minutes. Mandemaker sees similarities between her alternative approach to time and the ageing society. With these two works she hopes to invite the public to have a closer association with growing older, encouraging people to experience the ageing process in another way. She seeks to point up that this is an inevitable development that man must learn to deal with.",

The main thrust of his research is transformation in social architecture, specifically communal housing for the elderly, and the impact that hospitalization and commercialization have on this. Van den Langenberg made it his goal to revitalize the lifestyle of senior citizens by introducing an element of pleasure. This resulted in a collaboration with the design collective La Bolleur. Together they realized that Bingo, which is often played in care homes, strengthened contact between people thereby guaranteeing pleasure. The project The Medicine Called Fun is a new interpretation of the game whereby Bingo is designed as experience. The Bingo Set is conceived as a multifunctional piece of furniture with additional play elements. In taking part in the Seoul Design Festival, Van den Langenberg seeks to research communal housing for the elderly in Korea and develop the Bingo Set further.",

Her book NieuwGrijs (The New Grey) took shape as a result of a three-week stay in the parish of Oostburg and highlights her research into the town&#x2019;s increasing population shrinkage. She observes that young inhabitants are migrating to urban areas with the result that the number of inhabitants is dwindling and the parish&#x2019;s future population will become increasingly grey-haired. During her stay the designer questioned what impact this would have on a small town and how the quality of life could best be protected. In her book De Bruijn outlines a number of solutions to this problem, such as looking at the potential of unoccupied buildings to underpin social structures. In South Korea she aims to pinpoint the local problem surrounding the increasingly ageing and shrinking population in rural areas.",

This installation invites visitors to rest on an aromatized bed, which transmits its aromas in such a way that the experience stays with them during the day. The term Olfactory Memory refers to the recollection of odours. During Rensink&#x2019;s visit to Mushiya - where he bathed in Acorus gramineus, a Japanese herb - he discovered how a smell can become temporarily part of a person.

Re-covered is a blanket she developed made of soft, heavy weight fabric that stimulates contact with the material.

EP stands for extended player, a format in the music industry that exists somewhere between a long-playing record and a single. EP is also a kind of hybrid form where each publication is a single entity, yet all the editions can be seen as interrelated. Organizer professor Alex Coles of Huddersfield University and international participants from the Van Eyck Institute drawn from various disciplines (architects, designers, writers, theoreticians and artists) make up the editors. All the participants will carry out their own research and contribute to the edition, which could include an interview, essay, photographs, story or column. Design studio Experimental Jetset provides the graphics and editorial design and, in accordance with the thinking behind the publication, will also contribute to the content.  In the collaboration between both institutions, Huddersfield University provides the historical and academic viewpoint, and the Van Eyck that of makers and writers.  The application focuses on the research and editorial process. The publication comes out in autumn 2014.",

In April 2014, it has been exactly 20 years since the killings of Tutsis and moderate Hutus took place, leaving more than 500,000 people dead in 100 days. The project consists of an online, interactive documentary and an exhibition in FOAM. In both cases, the makers address the fine line between the (imposed) reconciliation and the underlying tensions. Central to the project is the radio soap Musekeweya (New Dawn), a very popular Rwandan soap that aims to bring the different communities closer together. The very medium that was used to summon Hutus to murder their Tutsi neighbours 20 years ago is now used for this dramatized peace message. Though happy endings dominate the soap, real time reconciliation is proving difficult. Love Radio follows the soap&#x2019;s writers, actors and listeners: Hutus and Tutsis who each carry their own memories. The premise of the documentary is that there is no such thing as &#x2018;the truth&#x2019;. There is room for different perspectives. The main characters, perpetrators and victims tell the story from every angle. The transmedia experience includes excerpts from Musekeweya and radio clips from 20 years ago. The production team is made up of photographer Anoek Steketee and filmmaker/journalist Eefje Blankevoort. Sara Kolster is supervising the online process and Kummer &amp; Herrman are responsible for the design.",

		"descriptionHtml": "Under the name The Age of Wonder, Baltan Laboratories put together a 2014 programme to mark the establishment of the Philips Physics Laboratory exactly 100 years ago. Baltan has been housed in the building of the former Philips Physics Laboratory in Eindhoven since October 2013. Consisting of three programmes that take place throughout the year, The Age of Wonder looks back on the history of the institute. The application pertains to the first programme, Het lab als geestelijke ruimte (The Lab as a Spiritual Space). For three days, the lab is open to (thought) experiments, with visitors being challenged to shift their cognitive paradigms and wonder about the world around them. The programme includes the re-enactment of several historical experiments. In the Alchemist&#x2019;s Cellar, the focus is on the development of a pre-war particle accelerator. There are lectures and workshops, and homage is paid to a Philips Physics Laboratory employee that died in 2013, Dick Raaijmakers.",

From a government point of view, the Smart Citizen is the ideal contributor to a participatory society: digitally and environmentally conscious, self-reliant and self-organizing. Zandbergen wonders how this idealized image relates to reality. Who has access to Smart Citizenship? Does it offer an alternative to the old hierarchical, polluting society? Or is the Smart Citizen a bubble and a toy for a small elite? Zandbergen examines the network around a number of pioneers in this field, such as De Waag Society and Network Democracy. In addition, she visits neighbourhoods and community centres to give &#x2018;ordinary citizens&#x2019; the floor. Zandbergen is organizing a number of public programmes around the four films, which each approach the subject asking a specific question. Zandbergen previously received a start-up grant for this project.",

This ensures that the physical interaction with projections and light effects is convincing. In the fifth development phase of the Integration series, the goal is to enable the performer to improvise with different available structures. In previous versions, these were captured in a predefined composition per scene. In addition, future performances require new equipment, which due to the precision necessary to reach a convincing effect, needs to be assembled by the maker himself.",

While death was previously a presence in the domestic environment, everything to do with the subject now happens inside institutions. The sociological effects of this shift have been sufficiently studied, but Allison Killing believes that architecture has thus far not devoted enough attention to it.

For this Pretty Smart Textiles has the Audax Textile Museum at its disposal. In the second phase a sample collection will be put together and developed in large format. A product presentation film will be made taking this sample as a springboard. Phase three focuses on the presentation of the collection at an international fabric show, the Premiere Vision in Paris. The grant application is for implementing the second phase.",

WORM notes that personal data is increasingly locked with the servers of a few dominant commercial parties. The original internet culture where each user was host owner of their own data has virtually vanished. Instead social media now dominate the internet and the connection between authorship and ownership has become diffused. SuperGlue is a system that enables users to simply create their own website and to host from a microserver that can be installed in their own home. Thus it flies in the face of the development of central data bases. In addition SuperGlue is offering opportunities to form local networks which in turn could lead to interesting case studies. SuperGlue is being developed in collaboration with Creating 010 and the &#x2018;Libre Graphics Research Unit&#x2019;.

Using a mobile application, the players are swept up in a narrative of approximately 20 minutes. During the game, players receive texts and directions via their Smartphones. In the course of the game, the players gain freedom as the app starts issuing strategic directions and tasks. This slowly blurs the line between game and reality, as players do not know whether the behaviour of other players is authentic or scripted. Players&#x2019; behaviour leads to new developments in the gameplay, allowing them to influence the storyline. The gameplay depends on the creativity of the players. The app awards points to the execution of tasks and the player with the highest number of points is the winner. Psychological insight and group dynamics are more important than acting talent.

However, every action provokes a reaction: the game uses intelligent traffic participants that appear to react autonomously to the moves the player makes. The player can build roads and erect new buildings, move small objects and perform specific actions. As the game continues the self-built city grows, which creates new opportunities for interaction. In the virtual world of Car Fun, time and thus the day-night rhythm and the change of seasons keep pace with that of the real world. The developments in the game continue even if the player is not playing. The creativity of the player is challenged. Through special &#x2018;gates&#x2019;, players can visit the cities of other players or invite them to come and see their own city.

In addition, the biennale will see the presentation of the next step in flex fabric moulding: a method derived from concrete production, but using lightweight materials such as PUR foam. The use of upholstery fabrics as moulds means that the material is immediately provided with its finish once the foam hardens. With this system, the eventual form is determined by both method and chance. That makes it possible to design pieces of furniture in an organic yet controlled manner. A chair and bookshelf are being designed for South Korea using this method.<br><br>During the biennale there will be a public talk between Tom Price (designer, London), Graig Appelbaum (Gallery Industry) and Atelier Remy &amp; Veenhuizen.

There is a difference between how time is perceived while looking at a painting, and how it is perceived while attending a music performance. This project by Spatial Media Laboratories depicts sound in a series of visual expressions, creating a publication of 24 pages of printed images with sensors and an audio player incorporated in the cover. When a page is turned, an accompanying soundtrack is played through headphones. Resonanz is thus both a book and a musical production. The images are programmed visual structures, which serve as visualization and notation of the sound. Telcosystems provides the content, programming and production. Its goal is to develop an innovative new medium that promotes the public interest in their practice. Telcosystems considers Resonanz to be the next step in its artistic development.",

Game Oven is responsible for the design and engineering of the technical game, Ernst Meisner for the design and engineering of the complementing dance. The game is a digital application. Two players hold a single Smartphone and have to rotate in different directions without letting go of the phone.  The players thus play together while Bounden teaches them to dance together. The centre of the screen features a ball onto which various symbols must be projected. To this end, the phone has to be rotated and as a result, the choreography is carried out. The game is suitable for all ages and offers a wide variety of dances and music. The dances are graduated. The design team is conducting additional experiments with various themes meant to strengthen the choreography and the gameplay. In order to match the audio and the game, symphonic music is used to both underscore the dance and for the ambient sounds.",

		"descriptionHtml": "Metrico is a game for PlayStation Vita about infographics in today&#x2019;s society. The game comes from Digital Dreams, an independent game-development studio in the Dutch Game Garden, Utrecht, and published in collaboration with Sony Computer Entertainment America (SCEA). In Metrico, a player finds himself in a world filled with all sorts of infographics, such as bar charts, line charts and pie charts. All these infographics respond to the movement, input and activity of a player. For example, input can indicate how a player holds the PS Vita, how much sound he makes, and how often it goes off. In every situation a player has to experiment to find out which infographics respond to which what activity. <br><br>During South by Southwest 2014, Digital Dreams wants to introduce Metrico to a new, North American audience. Other designers at the Austin event will also be able to provide feedback and advice on how to improve Metrico. In addition, the studio wants to use the festival as a platform to establish relations with business partners and artists with an eye on future collaboration. <br><br><div class=\"vid\"><div class=\"vidcon\"><iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/r4tFt6rArRk\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><br><br>This project is supported in the context of the <a href=\"http://stimuleringsfonds.nl/en/latest/news/349/one-off_open_call_participation_in_milan_cape_town_and_austin_events\">&gt;&gt; One Off Open Call for Participation in Milan, Cape Town and Austin</a>",

		"descriptionHtml": "Empire: The Unintended Consequences of Dutch Colonialism is a series of four interactive non-fiction documentaries by Dutch-American duo Eline Jongsma and Kel O&#x2019;Neill about the present-day effects of Dutch colonialism. From the 17th to the 20th centuries, the Dutch possessed colonies from South Africa to Indonesia, and from New York to the South American coast. The impact of those colonial voyages is still felt in the cultures of people who live in these regions. Empire shows viewers the present-day effects through personal stories. Among those featured are a descendant of West African slaves who works in a Surinamese goldmine, and a group of Afrikaners who have set up an exclusively white community.<br><br>Empire was recorded in ten countries over a four-year period. The result can be seen in installations that present the documentaries on various screens. The fragmentary viewing experience, in which visitors can see a number of stories at the same time, reflects the complex and contradictory nature of the post-colonial era. The same principle is pursued in a web application for the Empire project, which involves scrolling from story to story. <br><br>The goal is to feature the film within the Digital Domain film program of SXSW. The festival provides an opportunity to bring the project to the attention of a large audience made up of leading figures in the fields of art, technology and film.<br><br>This project is supported in the context of the <a href=\"http://stimuleringsfonds.nl/en/latest/news/349/one-off_open_call_participation_in_milan_cape_town_and_austin_events\">&gt;&gt; One Off Open Call for Participation in Milan, Cape Town and Austin</a>",

The research project was initiated by Studio Richard Vijgen to evaluate the values, intentions and metaphors of early internet usage. <br><br>The World Wide Web is often described as a gigantic digital library to which everybody can contribute by constructing his or her own homepage. So the first citizens of the net made pages about themselves and their interests. For this they used Geocities, a free web-hosting service that took as its starting point a virtual city where you could obtain a free &#x2018;piece of land&#x2019; to build a page in a certain thematic &#x2018;neighbourhood&#x2019;. Ten years later, with the rise of social media, Geocities has been abandoned and the provider has disappeared. But just before it closed down, the Archive Team made a backup of the site in an attempt to save 10 years of shared work by 35 million people. The resulting files form a chapter in our recent online history and are the subject of The Deleted City. <br><br>The project will be presented during South by Southwest 2014 and provides an opportunity to tell the story behind The Deleted City and our early digital culture to an audience that is the driving force behind our contemporary digital culture. The festival also offers a chance to meet potential American clients. <br><br><div class=\"vid\"><div class=\"vidcon\"><iframe src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/55431868?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0\" class=\"vid\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br><br>This project is supported in the context of the <a href=\"http://stimuleringsfonds.nl/en/latest/news/349/one-off_open_call_participation_in_milan_cape_town_and_austin_events\">&gt;&gt; One Off Open Call for Participation in Milan, Cape Town and Austin</a>            \n        </div>\n        <div class=\"exfb bot\">afgerond: March &apos;14<br><br><a href=\"http://richardvijgen.nl/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"South by Southwest 2014 - The Deleted City\">website</a><br></div>        \n        \t<div class=\"slink-con\">\n\t\t<div class=\"slink-upper clrfx\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"sh-b\">\n\t\t\t\t<a class=\"sh-link tw-sh\" title=\"twitter share\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=South+by+Southwest+2014+-+The+Deleted+City http%3A%2F%2Fstimuleringsfonds.nl%2Fen%2Fgrants_issued%2Fsouth_by_southwest_2014_the_deleted_city%2F1934%2F via @StimuleerFonds\"> </a>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"sh-b\">\n\t\t\t\t<a class=\"sh-link fb-sh\" title=\"facebook share\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fstimuleringsfonds.nl%2Fen%2Fgrants_issued%2Fsouth_by_southwest_2014_the_deleted_city%2F1934%2F\"> </a>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"sh-b\">\n\t\t\t\t<a class=\"sh-link ln-sh\" title=\"linkedin share\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fstimuleringsfonds.nl%2Fen%2Fgrants_issued%2Fsouth_by_southwest_2014_the_deleted_city%2F1934%2F&amp;title=South+by+Southwest+2014+-+The+Deleted+City\"> </a>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"sh-b sh-l\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a title=\"share link\" class=\"l-sh\" href=\"#\"> </a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"l-sh-txt h5\">share link</span>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"sh-b sh-p listprint\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a title=\"print\" class=\"p-sh\" href=\"#\"> </a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"p-sh-txt h5\">print</span>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t            \n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"slink-lower\">  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<input class=\"dlink-input\" type=\"text\" value=\"http://stimuleringsfonds.nl/en/grants_issued/south_by_southwest_2014_the_deleted_city/1934/\" readonly>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t</div>",

During a visit to Seoul it will chart the demand for Dutch-designed products among South Korean businesses.<br><br>South Korea, a country previously so hermetically isolated, is working hard to catch up. In 2008 the city of Seoul set up the Seoul Design Foundation to stimulate the design industry in Korea. Two years later, Seoul was earmarked as World Design Capital by ICSID (International Council of Industrial Design). Korea aspires to become the &#x2018;design hub&#x2019; of Asia.<br><br>It is in this context that the East West Education Center wants to send a small delegation of prominent Dutch product designers to South Korea during the Seoul Living Design Fair (26-30 March 2014). This visit offers an opportunity to make contact with Koreans firms, designers and media, and to assess the interest in Dutch design products. At the same time, East West Education wants to assess what concrete forms of collaboration are possible between Dutch and Korean designers. <br><br>This project is supported in the context of the <a href=\"http://stimuleringsfonds.nl/en/latest/news/open_call_exploring_opportunities_for_internationalization/\">&gt;&gt; Open Call Exploring Opportunities for Internationalization</a>",

In these countries they build factories where low-wage workers can produce goods. Where and how do these workers live at present? And how would they ideally like to live in the future?

The symposium focuses on students and professionals in the theatre world and e-culture, and the organizers seek to provide an overview of the most recent developments and new opportunities in the future. The aim is to foster the development and exchange of knowledge among makers. The programme includes presentations, workshops and the realization of pilot versions of two transmedia performances. The programme pinpoints the creation process and the generation of a vision, and also reflects on the thinking behind transmedial processes. In addition to the symposium, Stichting Story Based Media is launching a website to introduce the programme. After the symposium, this website will be regularly updated with new content thereby creating a new transmedial information platform.",

A growing group of makers and users are arguing for far-reaching, free availability of artistic and cultural products. They maintain that unlimited opportunities for sharing knowledge and products would allow digital culture and creativity to be opened up. The day programme initially focusses on makers and professionals. Here the emphasis is on exchange and extending the scope and depth of knowledge by means of debate, and on familiarizing themselves with open-data models. The evening programme is aimed at a broad culturally aware public. An interdisciplinary programme highlights the best examples in the field of Free Culture including music, performance and film.

As the installation is set up in a darkened room, the audience perceives the pulsating lights and the sound separately. Through software, the lined-up objects perform complex choreographies that give the audience the impression that they are imitating each other, or interacting. The light and sound sources sometimes show disrupted, chaotic behaviour; then harmony is restored. With this installation, creators Joris Strijbos and Daan Johan are exploring the perception of light, sound and swarm behaviour.

Initiated by Baltan Laboratories, the entire project consists of three parts, of which the first part has already been launched. That is why only two parts are included in the application. In collaboration with Holst Research Centre in Eindhoven and Imec in Belgium, an artistic research has been set up that revolves around the extraordinary &#x2018;communicative&#x2019; characteristics of the agave plant. The results of the research are to be presented during the Dutch Design Week.

The idea behind Ledwork is to formulate new, meaningful ways to deal with new technological developments related to LED lighting. It looks in particular at how tact and gestures can be deployed as playful and powerful tools in dealing with LEDs and technology. <br><br>The result is a light-emitting object with geometric forms that invites people to pick it up and play with it. Thanks to its magnetic connectors, the separate pieces can be stacked on top of each other like Lego blocks to create new forms. Each new connection has an effect on the entire construction. With Ledwork, everybody becomes a sort of designer by observing structures, studying them, taking them apart, and building them up again. <br><br>Ledwork wants to market the product and sees the Salone del Mobile as a perfect opportunity to generate interest in it. During the fair the designers behind Ledwork hope to forge new partnerships for distribution and sales. <br><br>This project is supported in the context of the <a href=\"http://stimuleringsfonds.nl/en/latest/news/349/one-off_open_call_participation_in_milan_cape_town_and_austin_events\">&gt;&gt; Open Call for Participation in Milan, Cape Town and Austin</a>",

It forms part of a long-term research theme that emerged as a result of the Kontraste Festival &#x2013; Electric Shadows in Austria and of the 2012 publication of the cahier A Ray of Darkness. The book ties in with the interdisciplinary approach of the festival with its cross-boundary take on the visual arts, music, technology and science. That which we cannot know or understand forms the springboard for the essays, interviews and visual contributions by artists and scientists. With this publication, the editors of Sonic Acts are ensuring the continuation of the research. Insights and connections that emerged during the festival are further developed in the book. Sonic Acts is organizing a symposium centred round the publication of the book and this will ensure visibility beyond the momentum of the festival.",

The collection includes a table, shelves and textile. Moreover, the presentation features a series of photographs by Luisa Zanzani that document the production process. <br>The collection is the result of collaboration with various specialist organizations and sponsors, including: Beeldenstorm, Eindhoven; National Glass Museum, Leerdam; INGV, Italy; Het Audax Textile Museum, Tilburg; Eran Galore, an Israeli expert on RD printing; and a host of Sicilian organizations where workshops were held.<br><br>With the project De Natura Fossilium at the Salone del Mobile 2014, Studio Formafantasma wants to show not only the potential of lava to an international audience but also the innovative collaborative partnerships that the studio entered into in order to study this material. <br><br>This project is supported in the context of the <a href=\"http://stimuleringsfonds.nl/en/latest/news/349/one-off_open_call_participation_in_milan_cape_town_and_austin_events\">&gt;&gt; Open Call for Participation in Milan, Cape Town and Austin</a>",

Outdoor spaces play an important role in social and cultural exchanges in the city. The Netherlands enjoys an exceptional tradition when it comes to public green space, with legislation that devotes attention to ecologically responsible urban development and progressive research in the field of garden design.<br><br>During the Salone del Mobile 2014, aMAZElab wants to promote this Dutch expertise directly by designing the centrally located Porta Nuova area between Garibaldi railway station and Corso Como in Milan. In addition, LANDSCAPING offers an extensive public programme of bike routes, conferences and an exhibition. For this it is working with various Dutch offices and firms, including garden designer Piet Oudolf, who is the subject of a photography exhibition and whose design will be implemented in Porta Nuova; bee-keepers collective BEE Collective; and design studio Floris Wubben. <br><br>This project is supported in the context of the <a href=\"http://stimuleringsfonds.nl/en/latest/news/349/one-off_open_call_participation_in_milan_cape_town_and_austin_events\">&gt;&gt; Open Call for Participation in Milan, Cape Town and Austin</a>",

Its conceptual activism, and the political proposals that represent the ideas of a generation, have left their mark on the political and cultural climate in the Netherlands.

Play the City is selecting three districts of middle, low and high incomes. To enable residents to take part in forming a vision for their own city, spatial issues are being presented to some 300 people. A RFID card gives them the opportunity to vote and make their views known. Play the City is joining forces with Mediamatic for the implementation of the RFID technology. Alongside the residents, policy makers are also invited to take part. The results will be visualized in graphics and maps, which are to be showcased during the Design Biennale in Istanbul. To tie it all in with the Dutch situation, the methodology is to be tested in Amsterdam North and exhibited in the Kijkruimte. To round the project off, Play the City is organizing a public debate in which policymakers, designers and housing associations can discuss the results of the project.",

The identification of these intersections and the identification of success and failure factors in the realisation of these intersections is therefore important. The study consists of four phases. In the first phase, interviews, literature research and existing theory will be used to develop a framework to fully understand the soft intersections. In the second phase, intersections in the Amsterdam and Berlin metropolitan regions will be detected and roughly charted. The third phase consists of research that focuses on a small number of cases in which researchers look at the creation and the effect of the intersections, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Finally, the findings of the case studies will be compared with the findings of the theoretical framework drawn up previously. With the findings of the research, the applicant expects to be able to offer a handle for the development of soft infrastructure.",

Various authors offer a subjective answer to this question. Issue 91 is about non-canonical modern architecture. In this, OASE shows another way of building with modernist principles than we are familiar with from famous modern buildings. Issue 92 has two guest editors &#x2013; Peter Zumthor and Juhani Pallasmaa &#x2013; and is devoted to the theme of atmosphere. The theoretical background to the notion of atmosphere will be discussed, and the editors will explore the contemporary relevance of the notion by highlighting other realised projects.

Archis is now applying for a subsidy to examine three issues in more detail. First, the study will focus on the presence of peace missions in an area. The physical expression of the present seems similar to that of war. Elements such as barbed wire, sand bags, checkpoints and armoured vehicles dominate public space. Archis is examining how this gap between intention and expression can be bridged. The deployment of spatial instruments after the arrival of peace troops is a second question that the applicant wants to consider. Two aspects that will be explored further are the role of public space in preventing public disturbances and overcoming socio-spatial problems. The third issue is how knowledge about former conflict areas can be used in western cities. That is why Archis is studying what role the everyday surroundings play in the emergence of conflict situations such as the riots in London in 2012 and in Paris in 2005. The results of the study will be presented during exhibitions and debates in The Hague, Istanbul and Ankara.",

The author then uses examples to show what influence the bicycle could have on the city. For this he describes the motivation for cycling in cities like New York, Amsterdam and Singapore. In the following chapters Flemming supports his assertion that the number of cyclists is increasing in cities, and he establishes a link between mobility and architecture. This results in tools of a practical and substantive nature concerning the design of infrastructure and architecture that provide space for the bicycle. The final chapter contains the research conclusions. The publication appears in English.",

This theme is explored by means of three case studies: the &#x2018;hybrid kiosk&#x2019; that focuses on the everyday use of public space; the &#x2018;space for wild living&#x2019; where alternative dwelling forms are explored; and &#x2018;autoni&#xEB;&#x2019; that takes cultural identity as the driving force for urban development. All three studies are to lead to concrete interventions and activities in the area. TU Delft and The Hague Academy of Fine Arts are also involved and foreign visiting critics have been appointed to respond to the results. The programme is presented twice: in April 2012 in the Haagse Havens as CounterSite, within the framework of the IABR; and again in October 2012 when the results, which will have been further developed, can be viewed as an independent event.",

As businesses are closing down new agrarian sites are becoming available, ad hoc, for redevelopment. New economic infill projects for these sites are often complex and of an urban nature which calls for good spatial adaptation. At present, however, this urban concept is lacking. The programmatic brief focuses on developing spatial strategies offering an integral solution to transformations in the countryside. A search for potential solutions is to be launched simultaneously in the Kop van Noord Holland, West Brabant and Zeeuws Vlaanderen (Zeeland Flanders). Broadly speaking the programme is made up of two strands. Knowledge is to be developed during knowledge workshops (two sessions per region) and by an educational programme. In conjunction with the regional parties concerned, this knowledge will then be discussed in thematic salons, prompting further research to be fleshed-out by design practices. The provinces are involved in both strands. The educational strand includes a winter term at the Amsterdam Academy of Architecture, a seminar at the University of Wageningen and an optional course at TU Delft. The results of the programme are to be made known via a website, a publication with a small print-run, a spread in the magazine Blauwe Kamer and a documentary. Each region is to have a sounding-board group and, to coordinate the whole, the project is supervised by an advisory board.",

In the publishers opinion the insights and ideas that the architect has developed since the 1960s remain relevant. The foreword places Luc Deleu thematically and historically in a broader context, while also addressing the relevance of his work for contemporary urbanism and architecture. In the body of the book, seven writers and seven artists reflect upon Luc Deleu&#x2019;s work, drawing on seven themes: architecture, depiction, mobility and sculpture. The essays are accompanied by images that illuminate the context or provide a snapshot of the office&#x2019;s work. The book ends with a timeline related to contextual terms. The book is to be published in English.",

The publication is an historical lecture by Piranesi and serves as inspiration for the current design brief in cities. It also provides a contribution of topical relevance to the architectonic discourse on cities. The book consists of three parts. The first part is a manifesto that uses the work of a number of philosophers to act as a springboard for spatial theory-building. Subsequently the author introduces the term flight lines, placing this in a new theoretical framework which, in the publisher&#x2019;s opinion, provides inspiring jumping-off points for contemporary design. The third section is an essay on the architectonic landscape which addresses the city becoming landscape and the landscape becoming architectonic; here the term flight lines returns. The conclusion highlights the fact that the lines enhance the city for everyone. The book is published in English.",

In the first part, the office examines the controlling mechanisms of urban-design practice in Seoul and collects cartographical information and data from four districts. This is followed by an in-depth study of the district and the collating of the transformation of buildings. In the second part of the study, NEXT Architects pinpoints the limitations of the Dutch planning model and carries out design-based research into the potential impact of a dynamic planning method. The office subsequently carries out case studies in four districts. The results of the various different research phases are to be circulated among colleagues and other parties involved. There is the possibility of a publication and an exhibition. NEXT Architects hopes that the research will spawn an alternative toolbox for a plan-driven Dutch urbanism and create more space for dynamic developments.",

The Atelier Coastal Quality aims to connect all the parties involved in design, research and debate across all levels of planning and timescales. The aim is to develop new perspectives by linking safety to economic opportunities and spatial quality. The atelier is made up of three main sections. The teaching and research at TU Delft focuses on analysis and on pinpointing the coastal briefs, while also focusing attention on international comparison of coastal areas. The section Laboratory brings together the different professional parties for concept forming and design. Each year four or five specific briefs are worked on concurrently. The third section functions as a podium. Debates, exhibitions, publications and a website serve to circulate the generated plans and visions. The current participating parties are the provinces of South and North Holland, the municipality of The Hague and TU Delft. In the Laboratory section they are joined by the Delta Coastal Programme, the Rijkswaterstaat and water management authorities.<br><br>The <a href=\"http://stimuleringsfonds.nl/nl/projecten/1347/atelier_kustkwaliteit/\">program</a> continues in 2012.",
